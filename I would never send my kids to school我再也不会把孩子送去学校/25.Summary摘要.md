- respiratory infections are one of the chief destroyers of productivity
- it is possible to avoid infections for decades in otherwise vulnerable individuals

### 25.8.1 Alzheimer's

### 阿兹海默症

- the root neuronal cause of Alzheimer's is excitotoxicity, which comes from excessive cognitive loads on networks with insufficient processing power
- good learning is preventive, while bad learning may contribute to Alzheimer's
- the best reassurance for the positive impact of learning on prevention of Alzheimer's is the adherence to the [Fundamental law of learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Fundamental_law_of_learning)
- schooling inherently violates the [Fundamental law of learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Fundamental_law_of_learning) through its coercive nature
- for many kids, schooling leads to neural injury, which may be instantly apparent, e.g. in developing depression
- despite all calls for reforms, mainstream schooling in the western world still keeps evolving in the wrong direction: more haste, more stress, greater loads, less coherence, and more neural injury
- main factors of schooling that lead to excitotoxic injury are: overload, low coherence, high interference, low retention, low [stability](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stability), sleep deprivation, [circadian violations](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Natural_creativity_cycle), [stress](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_resilience), and [toxic memories](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Toxic_memory)
- even though literacy is preventive, bad learning and bad habits taken from school may contribute to Alzheimer's pathology later in life

### 25.8.2 ADHD

### 注意缺陷多动障碍

- a creative and lively child may easily be branded [ADHD](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/ADHD) by parents, teachers, or "well-wishing" strangers
- what a teacher recognizes as [ADHD](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/ADHD) may actually be a sign of giftedness
- schooling provides an ideal breeding ground for ADHD-like problems and symptoms in otherwise healthy kids
- diagnostic criteria for [ADHD](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/ADHD) in DSM-5 (2013) have been relaxed, which may lead to further overdiagnosis
- ADHD may be managed better by understanding the circadian and homeostatic aspects of mental activity
- circadian disruption may amplify symptoms of ADHD, or lead to a wrong diagnosis
- free running sleep is vital for managing ADHD
- before administering medication, e.g. Ritalin, children should be evaluated in free running condition, i.e. away from pressures of schooling (see: [prescription](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/ADHD))
- psychiatric drugs target receptors and neurotransmitters, not specific brain structures. As such they are bound to have [side effects](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Indiscriminate_action_of_psychiatric_drugs)
- schedule designed around the circadian cycle may mitigate all negative aspects of [ADHD](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/ADHD)

- learning a language is costly
- kids who learn English only at school can hardly ever speak English
- (formal) language learning in children is largely futile
- a month with [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo) can bring as much vocabulary as 13 year of schooling (see: [Learning English](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_English))
- in the course of 6 years, I learned no English at school
- [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo) helped me learn English and pass TOEFL at 99 percentile

### 学习历史

For details see: [Learning history: school vs. self-directed learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_history:_school_vs._self-directed_learning)

- average high school graduate knows little history
- most kids gain just about one [item](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_item) of history knowledge per week
- self-learning based on [incremental learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_learning) proved to be the fastest way to learn history
- national curricula often feed nationalist sentiments that harm global communication and cooperation

## 25.10 SuperMemo

- long-term memories established by [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo) keep interests alive and feed lifelong learning

## 25.11 My own experience

## 我自己的经历

- catching a cold was a joyous moment in my young life: I did not have to go to school!
