# 1999: Choosing the name: "spaced repetition"

## Quest for a good unique name

The term "*spaced repetition*" is very old and has been used for decades in the advertising industry, and in behavioral research. However, its modern meaning has been initiated in 1999 when [we](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_World) adopted it in lieu of the *SuperMemo method*.

In the early days of [SuperMemo World](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_World), we actively searched for a well-recognized scientific term to use when referring to "*the SuperMemo method*" in scientific contexts. The company's marketing strategy was to move away from a "*program developed by a student*" to a "*program based on a scientific method*". Unfortunately, memory and learning literature was scant in publications other than short-term studies of the [spacing effect](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spacing_effect) with a notable exception of [Harry Bahrick](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Harry_Bahrick)'s research on the retention of Spanish vocabulary.

Memory researchers have investigated various "[repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Repetition) schedules" for ages. Sometimes they used intervals of minutes. Sometimes they used "intervening [items](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Item)" to separate review. Three review patterns have been most prevalent: (1) **massed** with many [repetitions](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Repetition) in short time, (2) **distributed** with repetitions dispersed over time, and (3) **expanding** with increasing [intervals](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Interval). Spaced repetition relies on a progressively expanding schedule. Over decades, memory literature could not settle on a specific term to refer to the expanding schedule. Pimsleur used *graduated intervals*, [Bjork](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Bjork) used *expanding rehearsal*, Baddley used *distributed practice*, in my [Master's Thesis](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Master's_Thesis), I used *progressive schedule*, Pavlik uses more general *optimal schedule* that we know is progressive, etc. For more examples see: [Alternative terms for spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Alternative_terms_for_spaced_repetition).

A seminal article by Frank N. Dempster ["*The Spacing Effect A Case Study in the Failure to Apply the Results of Psychological Research*"](http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1989-03118-001) (American Psychologist, 43, 627-634, 1988) gave an early boost to [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo). The article deplored the fact that educators ignore the [spacing effect](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spacing_effect) in the pracise of learning. SuperMemo could fill the gap by providing a simple universal tool for spaced learning. Dempster freely used terms such as "spaced presentation", "spaced reviews", "spaced practise", "spaced tests", and even "spaced readings", or "well-spaced presentations".

We chose the term "*repetition spacing*" to be used instead of "*the SuperMemo method*". The [first-ever English language scholarly article](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/ANE1994) describing **computational spaced repetition** in 1994 used the term "*repetition spacing*" rather than "*spaced repetition*".

## Choosing the name: spaced repetition

On Feb 3, 1999, inspired by an e-mail from a user of [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo) (*Tony D'Angelo*), I reviewed literature using the keyword "*spaced repetition*". Upon that review, I [got convinced](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Attaching_the_name_"spaced_repetition"_to_SuperMemo) that we should move from using the term "*repetition spacing*" to "*spaced repetition*". The term "*spaced repetition*" was equally obscure and rarely used, but had a better use count than "*repetition spacing*".

We decided that in future SuperMemos, the term "*spaced repetition*" should be used instead of "*repetition spacing*". The first use of the term at [supermemo.com](https://supermemo.com/) probably came on Feb 4, 2000 in [SuperMemo is useless](http://super-memory.com/articles/useless.htm)

Over time, the term "*spaced repetition*" has become more and more popular. In that light, [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo) can also take credit for making this generic scientific term take root in public mind with a specific association to [optimum intervals](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Optimum_interval) in learning.

## The future of the name: spaced repetition

As of 1999, largely due to our choice of the name, the term "*spaced repetition*" has consolidated its presence in texts referring to flashcard applications, incl. those based on the [Leitner system](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Leitner_system). There is also a hope, the term will become dominant in scientific literature. All authors prefer to stick to the terminology they have used for years or decades. However, a great deal of terminological acceleration can be attributed to Wikipedia. The dominant term in there is *spaced repetition*, however, memory scientists tend to flock to *spaced retrieval* or *distributed practice* (which is a wider concept). There are also *island entries* like *spaced learning* that have been attributed by spambots to [Paul Kelly](https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/95418/bio) (at the time headmaster at Monkseaton High School).

This confusion contributes to the disconnect between research and popular applications of [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition), but the merger and unification are just a matter of time. Wikipedia uses a concept of *proposed mergers*. Scientists may oppose merging their "clean" puritanical articles with the popular clones peppered with commercial links. However, such a merger is inevitable and good. There are scientists who investigate [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition) today who do not know the term [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition), and never heard of [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo). There are also engineers who work on spaced repetition algorithms and know very little of actual memory research in the field. Both disconnects can be reduced by unifying the terminology. Google will do the rest.

[Unification of terminology](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Alternative_terms_for_spaced_repetition) under the banner of "**spaced repetition**" will serve both (1) further research and (2) practical applications
