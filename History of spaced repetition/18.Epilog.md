# Epilog

[Spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition) was [born on July 31, 1985](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/The_birthday_of_spaced_repetition:_July_31,_1985). Today it is used by up to [several hundred million students](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Exponential_growth_of_the_popularity_of_Algorithm_SM-2). Both facts were not too clear to me when I started writing this article. The history of spaced repetition as painted by this text may still be swept under the carpet of human history. However, I leave this article for future web archeologists to paint the truest picture. Perhaps in a not so distant future, intelligent machines will trace a tiny fraction of their [efficient operation](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_needs_to_sleep) to those first shaky steps in a little city of Poznan in Poland at the end of the second millennium?
