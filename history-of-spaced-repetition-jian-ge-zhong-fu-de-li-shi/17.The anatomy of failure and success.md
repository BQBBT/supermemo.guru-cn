# The anatomy of failure and success

## Formula for research failure

Some intuitions about [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition) are pretty common. This gives rise to a major question: why has not spaced repetition been investigated earlier and why didn't it permeate into the practice of learning? Intuitions are not enough, a good experimental design is also vital. This section explains why others were close but failed. How Ebbinghaus or Spitzer might have brought spaced repetition to life 90-130 years earlier. There must be something wrong with the immediacy of gratification in [peer review](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Peer_review) and battle for grants. Why is there so much buzz in the field of [drugging kids for school](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Confusing_creativity_with_ADHD), while diseases that take a heavy death toll in less developed countries get little interest?

In this chapter, I try to figure out why spaced repetition was so late to come. Here is my list of delay factors prioritized by their impact:

- computers make a dramatic difference in learning efficiency in [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition), early formulations would not be viral enough even in the era of the Internet
- web perpetuates knowledge and crystallizes its essence (e.g. at Wikipedia)
- intuitions do not ensure good experimental design. Myself, Ebbinghaus, Spitzer, and others, produced designs that would add more noise and complexity to the issue
- human culture is in a perpetual flow. We massively forget and re-discover old findings. This is as true of individuals as it is of cultures. Science is also subject to fads, fashions and forgetting. Only now, [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition) has reached the *"impact density"* needed to become *"common knowledge"*. See: [Discontinuity in the research on spacing effect](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Dempster:_There_are_discontinuities_in_science)
- self-interest and [self-learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-learning) are best drivers of applicability. Science permeates lives via practical applications. [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo) was the first practical application of [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition) that could reach [thousands and then millions of users](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Exponential_growth_of_the_popularity_of_Algorithm_SM-2)
- there used to be a great deal of confusion between short and long-term memory, between spacing in lists, and spacing in a single day, and even between procedural and declarative learning
- expanding, contracting or equally spaced schedule can all be [made superior given appropriate timing](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Karpicke:_Expanding_retrieval_schedules_produced_mixed_results)
- experimenters tend to use heterogeneous material (poems, lists, nonsense syllables, pages of questions, groups of students, etc.)
- experiments where passive review is used instead of [active recall](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Active_recall) do not benefit from the [testing effect](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Testing_effect)
- experiments where intervals are measured in *intervening items* are based on different memory mechanisms and should not even be labelled as *spaced repetition*. To this day, a lot of confusion in research is caused by mixing up the measures of intervals without a clear separation of terminology
- short-span of research projects makes [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition) investigations hardly possible
- focus on classroom applications has confused the outcomes. [Schools are not a good place for learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Problem_of_schooling). Research that optimizes for school environment is of little relevance in [free learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning)
- ages old distinction between *learning* and *retention* confuses the thinking about optimal education. The distinction comes from schooling in which we learn first and then pray to forget little
- terminology keeps mutating and this makes hard for new generations of researchers to capitalize on prior work. Even our own [1994 paper](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Optimization_of_repetition_spacing_in_the_practice_of_learning) uses the term *repetition spacing*. See [the list of terminological mutations](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Alternative_terms_for_spaced_repetition) to gauge the scope of the problem. Web, wisdom of the crowds, and wikis (like [this one](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_Guru)) are likely to remedy the problem of terminology

In 2006, Will Thalheimer produced an excellent research review of [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition) research. It was based on over 100 research articles. However, in the summary [Thalheimer cast doubt about the value of progressive spacing](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Will_Thalheimer:_Doubts_about_expanding_rehearsal). This shows that even dozens of papers won't help if the experimental design is based on incorrect models.

In [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition), it is not enough for review to be expanding. The review needs to be optimally expanding

## Failed experimentation

I will list three cases of experiments that were bound to fail or to confuse:

- **Herman Ebbinghaus** (1885) was motivated by the science of memory. His intuitions were excellent, however, in the name of purity, he focused on nonsensical syllables. Inadvertently, he contributed to [complexity of memory](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Complexity) and [interference](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Interference), which he aimed to avoid. His [forgetting curve](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Forgetting_curve) is ruthless and discouraging. Had Ebbinghaus learned meaningful material of interest, he might have had extended the scope of his experiment. We all know from school that cramming nonsense is a form of mental torture. Had Ebbinghaus opted for practical applications, like myself, we might have had a paper variant of [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition) born a neat 100 years before the fact. Naturally, without computers, without the web, his ideas might still fall into the pit of silence for a century, as much as it has actually happened to the concept of the [spacing effect](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spacing_effect)
- [**Herbert Spitzer** (1939)](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/History_of_spaced_repetition_(print)#Spitzer_experiment_.281939.29) was motivated by improving classroom performance. He opted for the worst case of heterogeneity. While I struggled with pages of mixed difficulty material, and Ebbinghaus struggled with meaningless material, Spitzer compounded those effects by the heterogeneity of minds. Instead of pages of questions, Spitzer had groups of pupils exposed to pages of reading materials. In those noisy conditions, it is hard to see the regularities of exponential [forgetting](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Forgetting) and [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition). Even if Spitzer's results were overwhelmingly positive, I doubt the bureaucracy of the education system would make a good use of the procedure. Education is driven by standardized testing, grades, and certificates. It is hardly ever driven by science and the actual impact of the learning procedure on learning outcomes. It is a factory system. Spitzer's efforts were as doomed as those [groundbreaking ideas of Benezet](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Early_math_instruction_may_backfire) produced a decade earlier (1929)
- **Wozniak** (1985). [My own misleading experiment](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/History_of_spaced_repetition_(print)#Wozniak1985) on spaced repetition started on Jan 31, 1985, and might have ruined my efforts had it sufficiently confused my mind. Luckily, before the results came in, I designed a [better experiment](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/The_birthday_of_spaced_repetition:_July_31,_1985), and was never impacted by the confusion.

## Ebbinghaus experiments (1885)

### The myth

A popular myth says that Ebbinghaus invented [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition) back in 1885. That myth was born from our own [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo) documentation. When we compiled the [history of SuperMemo](http://super-memory.com/english/history.htm) for the web in 1997, we added a few names with contribution to memory research. As explained [here](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Who_invented_the_name:_spaced_repetition%3F), it was important to keep SuperMemo grounded in science. My own contribution has always been minimized because of the negligible weight of my name. As Ebbinghaus came at the top of the list for chronological reasons, it soon gave birth to the idea that he was the father of [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition). Even our own materials evolved in that direction by mistake of careless editing. Today, the web is swamped with Ebbinghaus and the serrated set of forgetting curves. If you Google for the [forgetting curves](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Forgetting_curve), you will see this:

[![Google search for forgetting curves](https://supermemo.guru/images/thumb/8/8f/Google_search_for_forgetting_curves.jpg/400px-Google_search_for_forgetting_curves.jpg)](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/File:Google_search_for_forgetting_curves.jpg)

> ***Figure:** Google search for "forgetting curve" (November 2017). The "serrated set" of forgetting curves dominates the search. Many of the pictures are labelled by wrong attribution with the name of Hermann Ebbinghaus. The more fit origin of the picture is presented in Two components of memory*

These are the same serrated curves that I depicted in [Optimization of learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Optimization_of_learning) (1990):

[![img](https://supermemo.guru/images/thumb/0/0e/Hypothetical_mechanism_involved_in_the_process_of_optimal_learning.jpg/300px-Hypothetical_mechanism_involved_in_the_process_of_optimal_learning.jpg)](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/File:Hypothetical_mechanism_involved_in_the_process_of_optimal_learning.jpg)



Hypothetical mechanism involved in the process of optimal learning

For more on the myth see our blog: [Did Ebbinghaus invent spaced repetition?](http://www.supermemo.com/en/blog/did-ebbinghaus-invent-spaced-repetition)

### The fact

We should rather be amazed with the fact that Ebbinghaus did not come up with [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition). He was very close. He was touching all the right buttons.

This is what he wrote about the [spacing effect](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spacing_effect):

> For the relearning of a 12-syllable series **at a definite time**, accordingly, **38 repetitions, distributed in a certain way over the three preceding days, had just as favorable an effect as 68 repetitions made on the day just previous**. Even if one makes very great concessions to the uncertainty of numbers based on so few researches, the difference is large enough to be significant. It makes the assumption probable that *with any considerable number of repetitions* a suitable distribution of them over a space of time is decidedly more advantageous than the massing of them at a single time.

Why did [Ebbinghaus](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Ebbinghaus) not take the next seemingly obvious step to see how the forgetting curve changes upon review? For one, he did not test forgetting, but the saving on re-learning. His tests were a review. With my approach it is easy to want to achieve a set level of [retention](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Retention). It is conceptually less intuitive to ask for a set reduction in the cost of re-learning.

However, a solution to overcoming that conceptual obstacle would be to persist with learning. Creativity thrives on the investment of time and thinking in varying contexts. To me, the answer to the Ebbinghaus puzzle is very simple. Like a good scientist, Ebbinghaus was theory-perfectionist. He chose to memorize nonsense syllables to minimize [interference](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Interference) from his prior knowledge. Unfortunately, this had a few bad side effects:

- his lists were hard to learn and his [forgetting curve](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Forgetting_curve) was very steep. It makes for a very discouraging picture for any student who cares about remembering in the long term
- his lists gave him no [pleasure in learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Pleasure_of_learning). This is the exact opposite of what I experienced in [1985](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Birthday_of_SuperMemo). Every item in my paper collection was a little step forward in advancing my knowledge to a new level. Once I plotted my first [forgetting curve](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Forgetting_curve), I wanted to know what happens after the next review
- Ebbinghaus has focused on the time or effort needed for re-learning, while I always was primarily interested in [retention](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Retention) with little interest in how much time or effort is needed to bring the [recall](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Recall) back to 100%

I will then venture a claim that in all his heroic memorization efforts, Hermann Ebbinghaus got fed up with learning nonsense. This would break the most persistent student. My better luck came from the burning need for getting good results in learning. This resulted in self-perpetuation of the effort. This is helpful in overcoming creative obstacles.

Interestingly, in 2015, Jaap Murre [reproduced](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0120644) the original Ebbinghaus experiment with meticulousness worth Ebbinghaus himself (even digging into original manuscripts). Murre was prudent enough not to subject himself to the mental strain of nonsense syllables, which actually might have introduced some bias. He took the best subject available: a 22-year-old student who was rewarded with co-authorship of the publication. Incidentally, Murre seems to have been able to capture the [circadian](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian) effect of learning in that his curve shows a minor bump after the period of 24 hours.

### Saving on re-learning

There is a huge difference between [retrievability](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Retrievability) and "savings in re-learning". Depending on the timing, no retrieval may mean that the fact has "just been forgotten, and easily re-relearned" or "forgotten for good". Saving on re-learning may be non-zero on materials with zero [retrievability](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Retrievability). In simple terms, lack of access to memories does not imply zero [stability](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stability). In that sense, Ebbinghaus curve is not even a good expression of exponential forgetting. There will be a different saving on re-learning for difficult material and for easy material.

### Forgetting curve (1984)

While writing the [chapter about forgetting curves](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Exponential_nature_of_forgetting), I thought that my own notion of the [forgetting curve](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Forgetting_curve) was erroneous at the beginning. However, while digging into my archives, by accident, I discovered that I had also plotted a forgetting curve for the retention of English vocabulary in 1984, just a few months before designing [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo) on paper:

[![The very first forgetting curve for the retention of English vocabulary plotted back in 1984, just a few months before designing SuperMemo on paper](https://supermemo.guru/images/thumb/d/d0/Forgetting_curve_for_retention_of_English_vocabulary_%281984%29.jpg/600px-Forgetting_curve_for_retention_of_English_vocabulary_%281984%29.jpg)](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/File:Forgetting_curve_for_retention_of_English_vocabulary_(1984).jpg)

> ***Figure:** My very first forgetting curve for the retention of English vocabulary plotted back in 1984, i.e. a few months before designing SuperMemo on paper. This graph was not part of the experiment. It was simply a cumulative assessment of the results of intermittent learning of English vocabulary. The graph was soon forgotten. It was re-discovered 34 years later. After memorization, 49 pages of ~40 word pairs of English were reviewed at different intervals and the number of recall errors was recorded. After rejecting outliers and averaging, the curve appears to be far less steep that the curve obtained by Ebbinghaus (1885), in which he used nonsense syllables and a different measure of forgetting: saving on re-learning*

I forgot about the fact of plotting that curve. I presume, once I had [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo), that curve no longer seemed important or relevant. I was not focused on the "science of memory". I just wanted to get good results in learning. Apparently, I did not think that plotting a forgetting curve was a big deal. I nearly missed that figure in 2018 too as it was labelled in small print: *average speed of forgetting for the first memorization*.

The result came from 49 pages of 40-word pairs each, i.e. 1960 words (compare: [13 years of school in a month](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/13_years_of_school_in_a_month)). I did all my learning for learning's sake, not for the experiment. There was no experiment actually. All I needed was to collect the numbers from my actual learning effort and plot the curve. The simplicity of the calculation might also explain why I forgot the exercise so easily.

I wrote about simple intuitions before the [1985 experiment](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Birth_of_SuperMemo). In the light of this 1984 curve, it might seem that the intuitions may have been derived from that little experiment. What today seems obvious might not be that obvious without the crutch of that little calculation. However, I can guess that by Feb 1985, I have already forgotten my curve because I did not skip Stage A in the [spaced repetition experiment](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/The_birthday_of_spaced_repetition:_July_31,_1985). My forgetting curve agreed with the experiment and the first review interval should be 1 day indeed.

The erroneous notion of sigmoidal curves must have been born later. Today, I seem to recall remotely that I originally thought that the sigmoidal nature kicks in only after the first review. I might never know how my thought process worked at that time. All I cared was the efficiency of [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo). In the excitement of the discovery of SuperMemo, I forgot my curve for the entire 34 years. Today, that little graph matters only to illustrate how easily we can discover, forget, stray, re-discover, and then re-discover the original discovery. Memory is fallible. God bless [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition).

[![Forgetting curve (Wozniak 1984)](https://supermemo.guru/images/thumb/d/de/Forgetting_curve_%28Wozniak_1984%29.jpg/800px-Forgetting_curve_%28Wozniak_1984%29.jpg)](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/File:Forgetting_curve_(Wozniak_1984).jpg)

> ***Figure:** The very first forgetting curve for the retention of English vocabulary plotted back in 1984 (a few months before designing SuperMemo on paper). This graph was not part of an experiment. It was simply a cumulative assessment of the results of intermittent learning of English vocabulary. The graph was forgotten and re-discovered 34 years later. After memorization, 49 pages of ~40 word pairs of English were reviewed at different intervals and the number of recall errors was recorded. White circles correspond with recall derived from the average number of errors per page after a given interval. Logarithmic regression in orange provides the best fit. Power regression in red follows closely. This could be expected from heterogeneous material (pages of words). This is also very similar to the results obtained by Ebbinghaus (1885), except the curve is far less steep as befits meaningful material. As expected, exponential regression in white provides the weakest fit*

## Spitzer experiment (1939)

In 1939, Herbert F. Spitzer investigated various testing schedules on 3605 sixth-grade pupils in 9 Iowa cities. This was the entire population of 91 schools. The kids read a 6-page text and their knowledge was later tested with 25 specific questions.

Spitzer designed different testing schedules, however, the design clearly did not aim at optimum spacing, and his research summary did not make any recommendation in that respect.

[![Spitzer (1939) Diagram of Procedure](https://supermemo.guru/images/thumb/0/0b/Spitzer_%281939%29_Diagram_of_Procedure.jpg/500px-Spitzer_%281939%29_Diagram_of_Procedure.jpg)](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/File:Spitzer_(1939)_Diagram_of_Procedure.jpg)

> ***Figure:** Diagram of the testing procedure in Spitzer's experiment (1939). Kids were tested at varying intervals to see the effect of timing on results. Two groups received a* testing intervention *that could be used to draw some rudimentary conclusions on the effect of spaces on learning outcomes*

Only the first two groups of students used an expanding schedule. These were the groups that came top on tests, however, Spitzer attributed this to the [testing effect](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Testing_effect) as these were the only two groups with 3 tests, i.e. the middle test was interpreted as a "testing intervention" (rather than a [repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Repetition)).

> ***Figure:** Curves of retention in the testing procedure in Spitzer's experiment (1939). The graph shows the benefits of active recall and the impact of review interval. The picture is not too revealing for only two groups of kids received two "repetitions" in the form of tests*

In his recommendations, Spitzer focused on the power of the [testing effect](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Testing_effect), of what I call [active recall](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Active_recall) in reference to my flashcards of [1982](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Birthdate_of_SuperMemo). What I like about his paper is the recommendation that testing be used for students to correct their own knowledge, provide feedback, and thus give them a sense of their own progress. This stands in contrast to modern [testing](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Testing) that is more often used as a whip to push kids to do more learning.

Spitzer's diagram of intervals reminds me of [my own self-administered test](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/History_of_spaced_repetition_(print)#Wrong_experimental_design_may_lead_to_wrong_conclusions) that failed to produce convincing results. In Spitzer's case, [intervals](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Interval) are clearly clocked by school life rather than by demands of memory.

In his research, Spitzer exhibited ruthless [Gatesian approach](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Bill_Gates_is_wrong_about_education) to testing and learning, typical of early school innovators who often did more damage than good by being too thorough! Educators who do not employ the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) in the process, are doomed to fail even if they employ the best tools for boosting memory!

I cannot but remark on the issue of ethical considerations. While we slaughter millions of animals in the name of science, we might perhaps fail to notice that this research, with all the best intent at heart, used the labor of 3000+ involuntary participants. What is great for memory research does not need to be great for individual learning. In the era of Google characterized by the plethora of exciting learning material, I found the test texts used by Spitzer pretty offputting. Despite the fact that a great deal of effort was put into the selection of the subject matter and wording, I would consider coercive reading a violation of my freedom. Those materials might be much better than your school average, but schooling will always be about mass production and less about creative freedom.

Reading about a biology of banana plants in Spitzer's materials might be palatable to a gardener or a biologist, which I claim to be. However, why would kids need to read about bananas if their current interest was the Great Depression, the Dust Bowl, Nazi Germany, or baseball?

School is the time when we stop learning and start [cramming](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Cramming). It is the time when we lose the love of learning. Adding [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition) to this coercive mix could only make things worse

## Wozniak experiment (1985)

Before I [managed to compute optimal intervals](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Birth_of_SuperMemo) for reviewing pages with English vocabulary, I designed an experiment which might have put me on wrong tracks. The experiment was to show the value of the progressive increase in review intervals. Instead, it showed that equally spaced review might be superior.

Experiments in science should not be considered "failed" just because they come with unexpected results. However, in this case, unexpected results came from bad design, and might have resulted in confusion that would inhibit further progress. To this day researchers speak of "mixed results" in [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition) due to wrong design or even [simple terminological confusion](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Karpicke:_Expanding_retrieval_schedules_produced_mixed_results).

Fortunately, my intuitions about memory in 1985 were too solid, and it was pretty obvious that with rapid acceleration in the expanding length of [intervals](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Interval), [forgetting](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Forgetting) might overwhelm consolidation. My progressive schedule was simply not optimum. I would have certainly designed a better follow-up. Most of all, I wanted to continue learning with success. I doubt I would have given up without a good solution.

The experiment shows that it is not enough to have a good guess about what [optimum intervals](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Optimum_interval) are. The intervals actually need to be computed.

Archive warning: [Why use literal archives?](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Why_use_literal_archives%3F)

This text was part of: "*Optimization of learning*" by [Piotr Wozniak](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak) (1990)

At the beginning of 1985, I designed two experiments which consequently revolutionized my learning methodology and led to the formulation of the [SuperMemo method](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo).

The first experiment can be a good illustration of how a misconceived idea can yield valuable conclusions (the second is described [here](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Birth_of_SuperMemo)). It is a common intuition that with successive [repetitions](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Repetition), knowledge should gradually become more [durable](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stability) and require less frequent review. Thus repetitions separated by increasing [intervals](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Interval) should be more effective than those whose intervals are always the same. This belief proved to be false. Let us see an experiment which demonstrates the fact:

**Experiment on the influence of various repetition spacing patterns on the effect of repetitions on knowledge retention (Jan 31, 1985 - Aug 2, 1986)**

1. The memorized knowledge consisted of 195 items divided into three equal groups: A, B and C.
2. Each of the items had the following form:
3. All items of a particular group were memorized in one session by repeating them until all were known (group A - Jan 31, B - Feb 2, C - Feb 3).
4. Two final control dates were established: Dec 6-7, 1985 and Aug 1-2, 1986 on which the level of retention in all groups was measured at the same time (for each item the accuracy of recall was measured in a four grade scale).
5. Before the control dates, all of the groups A, B and C underwent 6 independent repetitions in the following intervals (expressed in days):

| Repetition number | Group A (equal spacing over a longer time) | Group B (spacing based on increasing intervals) | Group C (equal spacing in 30 days) |
| :---------------: | :----------------------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------: |
|         1         |                  18 days                   |                      1 day                      |               5 days               |
|         2         |                  18 days                   |                     5 days                      |               5 days               |
|         3         |                  18 days                   |                     9 days                      |               5 days               |
|         4         |                  18 days                   |                     24 days                     |               5 days               |
|         5         |                  18 days                   |                     44 days                     |               5 days               |
|         6         |                  18 days                   |                     70 days                     |               5 days               |

The intent of the experiment was to prove that increasing intervals are the best for memory consolidation (group B) as opposed to intervals that are evenly distributed (group A) or concentrated in time (group C). The results of the experiment are shown in Fig. 3.1:

> ***Figure:** (3.1) Experiment on the impact of massed, distributed, and progressive schedules on retention. Due to a poor choice of intervals, this experiment seems to show the superiority of long equal-length intervals over a progressive schedule used in spaced repetition (Piotr Wozniak, 1985-1986)*

The results of the second control are not present on the graph because of the prosaic fact that studying at the University of Technology [started in October 1985] required perfect knowledge of irregular verbs, therefore another measurement was pointless.

As it can be seen in Fig.3.1 above, the experiment yielded unexpected results proving that increasing   . The principle of using such intervals in the process of learning will be later be referred to as the**optimum repetition spacing principle**

While writing [History of spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/History_of_spaced_repetition), I found the original graphs in my archive. It is pretty obvious that *massed practice* is not a good approach:

## Why spaced repetition idea succeeded in the end?

[Spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition) is intuitive. After some reflection, it is even obvious. Why didn't we come up with solutions earlier? [SuperMemo on paper](http://super-memory.com/articles/paper.htm) would be feasible as soon as mankind came up with paper. However, in ancient times, the volume of vital knowledge was small enough for the brain to easily cope with the use of [natural learning methods](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning). By working in the field, the farmer quickly gains all necessary expertise that helps him excel for as long as health permits.

Things started changing with the arrival of print in the 15th century. Knowledge started proliferating and it also gained means of efficient perpetuation. Newton at plague years might be an interesting example of an individual who would theoretically benefit from spaced repetition. However, Newton's book collection was limited and the problems to think about and solve were so numerous that it is easy to imagine he would never be bothered with his failing memory. All he needed was to make notes.

Over the next two centuries, the stores of available knowledge kept increasing and human natural appetite for remembering might have been increasing at the same time. Research by Ebbinghaus in the 1880s is an example of a continual interest in the workings of memory. However, even today, most of the scientists are rarely bothered by their forgetting. Making notes and Google can satisfy most of the needs for most of them. When Vannevar Bush conceived [memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex) device in the 1930s, he saw it as a memory augmentation. However, even if memex was to be seen as a distant cousin of [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading) or [neural creativity](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Neural_creativity), all its knowledge, like in Google, lived predominantly outside of the human brain. My quest reminds me that of V. Bush except I want to see all that knowledge make a direct imprint on human creativity (see: [neural creativity](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Neural_creativity)).

Why was I particularly bothered by forgetting? There are many kids out there who like to show off at school. When my brother showed me how to differentiate needles of a spruce and a fir, in my 3rd-grade biology class, I was eager to show that I know more than your average kid. That eagerness was quickly [suppressed by schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Schools_suppress_the_learn_drive), but some traces survived. When we started learning chemistry in Grade 7, I was proud to be able to recall complex names like adenosine triphosphate or deoxyribonucleic acid. I was even looking up difficult chemistry names to memorize and impress. I memorized the details of the anatomy of a jawless fish. Again I tried to impress at school, but no one was interested.

When I got deeper into zoology in Grade 5, some kind of OCD for information started showing up. I wanted to know all animals in the Poznan zoo, their habitat, and even their taxonomy and Latin names. I got fantastic books with photographs of all animals and knowing them seemed like an interesting endeavour.

In 1974, I became interested in boxing, football, and sports in general. I used to visit the waste paper store in our school and search for sports journals. My colleague Robert asked me to collect pictures with naked ladies. I complied. My puberty was late and I was not interested. When the stack of photos spilled at home, I explained it to my mom "*not for me!*". She nodded compassionately with a smirk. In the meantime, I would use an iron to remove wrinkles from my recycled sports journal collection. I would stack them up neatly and archive by date. The stack filled up several shelves in bookcases in my room. That obsessive neatness would make for a disturbing picture for any parent, however, my mom was tolerant. I was free to follow my passions even if they seemed preposterous. I have no doubt that freedom is one of the vital ingredients of healthy development. Don't many kids show similar symptoms in obsessions with stamp collecting, postcards, and football cards? Pity most parents are not as tolerant as my mom, and [child's passions are easily extinguished](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Childhood_passions).

Some early drive in the direction of [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading) showed some time between ages 10 and 12. I started making notes about horses by following links in an encyclopedia (paper book). It was fun to start with one entry, and hope to write a booklet about horses by just following the links. In Grade 1 of high school (aged 12), I did a similar exercise with an encyclopedia of mammals. There was some inner need to codify all information about certain subjects in biology. I decided to write an encyclopedia-sized book about the living world. I used a typewriter at mom's work and my own rich illustrations to write the history of evolution. I never finished. The futility of that exercise should be obvious. It never bothered my mind. The effort was enjoyable and addictive.

I showed a similar informavorous nature when I started learning zoology, chemistry, biology, and later biochemistry during summer vacations 1977-1979 (aged 13-15). This was a definite start of my growing need for remembering. I would produce calligraphically written and meticulously illustrated books with my newly acquired knowledge. However, after a longer while that knowledge tended to evaporate. That futility started bothering me slowly. What's the point of writing books if soon they turn into the same dead material like all other books on the shelf?

Around the year 1981-1982 (aged 19-20), I started writing down my knowledge in the form of questions and answers for [active recall](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Active_recall) tests. I knew that this was the only way to preserve things in memory for longer. Needless to say, after a while, the chaotic review did not provide full satisfaction either. At that stage, I was clearly very hungry for knowledge. I wanted to remember. Simple intuitions led to simple experiments and then to a simple [SuperMemo for DOS](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_for_DOS). I was driven by practical applications that combined research with the [pleasure of learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Pleasure_of_learning).

As of that point, my path became deterministic. I loved learning too much to give up [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo) in difficult times. My love of learning was easily suppressed at school or when I was involved in running a business. However, once I decided to work from home (1997), the positive feedback loop has set in between learning, love of learning, and the progress of [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo). As this also happens to be the way to earn a living, that loop is for ever. Only bad health or death can break this cycle. That part of the formula for progress is easy to figure out.

What could parents do to facilitate similar passions in kids? I think two ingredients come into play: inspiration and freedom. While inspiration is helpful, freedom is essential. These days, inspiration can be found all around. YouTube plays a huge role where humans don't live up to the mark. All around the world, it is the freedom ingredient that is missing most. Kids are enslaved by schooling. They are also enslaved by authoritarian parenting. I was told many times that some of my crazy behaviors are a side effect of growing up without a father. This might be true. However, to compensate, I had three parents: my mom and two older siblings: inspiring brother and a childless sister who channeled all her love into the little brat of me. I venture a claim that I came to this world with a reasonable endowment, not much above the average. I often lingered at the bottom of the class. Rarely would I come to the lead. I have dozens of examples when I converted meager skills or a bit of talent into excellence in a narrow area of creative pursuits. Freedom and [rage to master](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Rage_to_master) were always the key ingredients. When I bread dozens of animals or collected dead body parts, my family might ask "*why is the kid not going to church instead?*". My mom would shield me from those influences and concerns. I could do things my own way.

My development was then primarily boosted by the impact of freedom. Freedom helps the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) thrive, and the learn drive has self-amplifying powers. This led me to obsessions that make it possible to boast today of fathering [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition). Passions and obsessions should be cherished. Instead, we tend to exterminate them in the name of robotization of development. We set benchmarks and ask kids to jump through the hoops. As if being led by the hand through college has ever contributed to anyone's independent thinking. This decorticating process needs to stop! The future belongs to [free learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning).

As for spaced repetition, the appetite for solving the problem of forgetting increased substantially with the arrival of personal computers. In the early 1990s, I heard it with increasing frequency from users of SuperMemo that they thought of a similar solution for themselves but decided to look around for a specific software application first.

It is the demands of school that cause most frustrations in students today, however, schools are not a good place for creative thinking. Students do flock to [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition) mostly because it is served on a silver platter. It is ready to consume. Very few contemplate their own solutions.

In addition to personal freedoms, some of the good fortunes that gave a good start to SuperMemo were: (1) free university in communist Poland, (2) family sponsorship in purchasing an outrageously expensive PC, (3) lenient schools that did not impose much on my free time, etc.

You will not see many 22-24 year olds tinkering with their own science at the cost of the state or their family. There is nothing wrong with young adults living with their parents if they pursue creative goals.

[Spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition) was born at the confluence of good forces: free learning in a communist system, the transition from communism to the market economy, and the arrival of personal computing. Those global processes were boosted by freedom at home, and a dose of healthy [obsession with learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Addiction_to_learning). The main ingredient of that equation is freedom. Freedom is replicable. All it needs is to be granted.

## First decade of SuperMemo: Battling skepticism

Skepticism surrounded the early days of SuperMemo in Poland. This was expressed pretty accurately in the Polish computer journal *Enter* in 1994 (see [full article](http://super-memory.com/articles/kowal.htm)):

> **SuperMemo might work but it cannot be that good**
> If one is convinced of the validity of what has been said about [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo), will he or she be already convinced that the program is a perfect cure for the ailing memory? Can it really capitalize on the properties of the nervous system and let learning proceed a dozen times faster than in standard circumstances? After all there have been generations of students trying to figure out better methods of learning, and a breakthrough comparable with SuperMemo seems highly unlikely even to quite an open-minded observer. [Wozniak](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak) discounts the low-probability argument as the viable source of skepticism, and says that he has more than once traced down evidence that SuperMemo-like approaches to learning have already been tried before with lesser or greater degree of success. Moreover, it is worth noticing that SuperMemo might not see the light were it not implemented as a computer program which can easily be transferred between individuals. In other words, it could have fallen into oblivion as the previous attempts to put order in the process of learning. One must remember that the skeletal algorithm of SuperMemo has been formulated in [1985](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Birth_of_SuperMemo), and only [1987](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Algorithm_SM-2) saw its very slow expansion in selected scientific circles in Poznan. Another turning- point to be kept in minds is that [SuperMemo World](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_World) would not have been [founded in 1991](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Employing_forgetting_curves_in_spaced_repetition_(1991)) were it not for the inspiring meeting of minds between [Wozniak](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak) and his colleague from the university, [Krzysztof Biedalak](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Krzysztof_Biedalak), currently SuperMemo World's Vice-President. Both top-students at the university, Wozniak intended to study neuroscience in the US, Biedalak wanted to do the same in the field of artificial intelligence. Only by coincidence, they were both thrown into the world of entrepreneurial science. All this shows that despite the fact that the principles of SuperMemo are extremely simple and might have been invented several dozen times independently in several dozen countries of the planet, SuperMemo is not just a run-of-the-mill. The distinctive merit of [SuperMemo World](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_World) was to put the idea in practice, invest a great deal of man-hours in the development of the software, and focus on marketing the idea to the potential customer. Otherwise, SuperMemo would have forever remained limited to the small circle of its early enthusiasts.

## The future is bright

I mentioned that the progress of [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition) has been bogged down by [guesswork, weak practical toolset, and terminological confusion](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/History_of_the_optimization_of_repetition_spacing). Today, all those factors fall by the roadside. New web applications come into force, they combine big data, and practical needs of users. They all use the same terminology: [forgetting curve](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Forgetting_curve), [spacing effect](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spacing_effect), and [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition). The future of learning looks brighter than ever.
