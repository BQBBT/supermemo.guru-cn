# 1986: First steps of SuperMemo

## SuperMemo on paper

On Feb 22, 1984, at the age of 22, I computed that, it would take me 26 years to [master the essential English vocabulary](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_English). If my learning rate did not improve, if I did not invest more time, I would need to wait till the decrepit age of 48. This seemed like eternity. With the arrival of [SuperMemo on paper](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_on_paper) that statistic improved dramatically overnight. Today, in [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo), the standard is 40,000 words in 4 years at 40 min/day (see: [Advanced English](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Advanced_English)). For me, **the waiting time for fluent English has been cut short 7-fold**.

In summer 1985, using [SuperMemo on paper](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_on_paper), I started learning with great enthusiasm. For the first time ever, I knew that all investment in learning would pay. Nothing could slip through the cracks. This early enthusiasm makes me wonder why I did not share my good news with others.

[SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo) wasn't a "secret weapon" that many users employ to impress others. I just thought that science must have answered all questions related to efficient learning. My impression was that I only patched my own poor access to western literature with a bit of my own research. My naivete of the time was astronomical. My English wasn't good enough to understand news from the west. America was for me a land of super-humans who do super-science, land on the moon, do all major discoveries, and will soon cure cancer and become immortal. At the same time, it was a land of Reagan who could blast Poland off the surface of the earth with his Pershing or Cruise missiles (deployed in Europe in 1979). That gave me a couple of nightmares. Nuclear missiles might have been the only major source of stress for me in the early 1980s. I often ponder amazing inconsistencies in the brains of toddlers and kids. To me, the naivete of my early twenties tells me I must have been a late bloomer with very uneven development. Ignorance of English translated to the ignorance of the world. I was a young adult with areas of strength, and areas of incredible ignorance. In that context, [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition) looks like a child of a need combined with ignorance, self-confidence, and [passion](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Passion_and_memory).

## University: computer science

In October 1985, I started my 5 years course in computer science at the University of Technology (Poznan). I lost my passion for the university in the first week of learning. Instead of programming, we were subjected to excruciatingly boring lectures in introductory topics: math, physics, electronics, etc. With a busy schedule, I might have easily become a [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo) dropout. Luckily, my love for biochemistry and my need for English would not let me slow down. I continued my [repetitions](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Repetition), adding new pages of knowledge from time to time. Most of all, I had a new dream: to have my own computer and to do some programming on my own. One of the first things I wanted to implement was SuperMemo. I would keep my pages on the computer, and have them scheduled for review automatically.

I casually mentioned my "super-learning method" to my high school friend [Andrzej "Mike" Kubiak](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Mike_Kubiak) only in summer 1987 (Aug 29). We played football and music together. I finally showed him how to use SuperMemo on Nov 14, 1987. It took 836 days (2 years 3 months and 2 weeks) for me to recruit the [first user of SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Exponential_adoption_of_spaced_repetition). Mike was later my guinea pig in trying out [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo) in procedural learning. He kept practicing computer-generated rhythms using a SuperMemo-like schedule. For Mike, SuperMemo was a love at first sight. His vocabulary rocketed. He remained faithful for many years up to a point when the quality of his English outstripped the need for further learning. He is a yogi. His trip to India, and regular use of English have consolidated the necessary knowledge for life.

## ZX Spectrum

In 1986 and 1987, I kept thinking about implementing [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo) in software more and more often. Strangely, initially, I did not think much about the problem of separating pages into individual [flashcards](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Item). This illustrates how close-minded we can be when falling into a routine of doing the same things daily. To get to the status of 2018, SuperMemo had to undergo dozens of breakthroughs and similarly obvious microsteps. It all seems so simple and obvious in hindsight. However, there are hidden limits to human thinking that prevented [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading) from emerging a decade earlier. Only a fraction of those limits come from technology.

In my first year at the university, I had very little time and energy to spare. Most of my time I invested in getting my first computer: ZX Spectrum (Jan 1986). I borrowed one from a friend for a day in Fall 1985, and was totally floored with the magic. I started programming "on paper" long before I got the toy. My first program was for "planning the day". It was a precursor of [Plan](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Plan). The program was ready to type in into the computer when I turned on my ZX Spectrum for the first time on Jan 4, 1986. As of that day, I spent most of my days on programming, ignoring school, and writing my programs on paper even during classes.

## The Army

Early 1986 was marred by the threat of [conscription](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Conscription). I thought that 5 more years of university meant 5 more years of freedom. However, The Army had different ideas. For the Polish communist army, the second major did not count. I had to bend over backwards to avoid the military service. My anger was tripled by the fact that I would never ever contemplate 12 months of separation from my best new friend: ZX Spectrum. I told the men in uniform that they really do not want to have an angry man with a gun in their ranks. Luckily, in the mess of the communist bureaucracy, I managed to slip the net, and continue my education. To this day, I am particularly sensitive to the issues of freedom. Conscription isn't much different from slavery. It was not the type of conscription in the name of combating fascism. It was a conscription for mindless drills, goosestep, early alarms, hot meals in a hurry, and stress. If this was to serve the readiness of Communist Bloc, this would be a readiness of [Good Soldier Švejk Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_Soldier_Švejk). Today, millions of kids are sent to school in a similar conscription-like effort verging on slavery. Please read my *"I would never send my kids to school"* for my take on the coercive trample of the [human rights of children](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Education_as_a_human_right). I am sure that some of my sentiments have been shaped by the sense of enslavement from 1986.

On the day when the radioactive cloud from Chernobyl passed over Poznan, Poland, I was busy walking point to point across the vast city visiting military and civilian offices in my effort to avoid the military service. I succeeded! The summer of 1986 was one of the sunniest ever. I spent my days on programming, jogging, learning with [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo) ([on paper](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_on_paper)), swimming, football, and more programming.

## Summer 1986

My appetite for new software was insatiable. I wrote a program for musical composition, for predicting the outcomes of the World Cup, for tic-tac-toe in 3D, for writing school tests, and many more. I got a few jobs from the Department of Biochemistry (Adam Mickiewicz University). My hero, Prof. Augustyniak, needed software for simulating the melting of DNA, and for fast search of tRNA genes (years later that led to a [peer review](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Peer_review) publication). He also commissioned a program for regression analysis that later inspired progress in [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo) (esp. Algorithms SM-6 and SM-8).

While programming, I had SuperMemo at the back of my mind all the time, however, all my software was characterized by the absence of any database. The programs had to be read from a cassette tape which was a major drag (it did not bother me back in 1986). It was simpler to keep my SuperMemo knowledge on paper. I started dreaming of a bigger computer. However, in Communist Poland, the cost was out of reach. Once I computed that an IBM PC would cost as much as my mom's lifetime wages in the communist system. As late as in 1989, during a student training, I could not afford a visit in a toilet in the Netherlands because it was so astronomically expensive when compared with wages in Poland. In those days, I was able to live abroad on a diet of a single banana per day.

## My first personal computer: Amstrad PC 1512

My whole family pulled in resources. My cousin, Dr Garbatowski, arranged a special foreign currency account for Deutsch Mark transfers. By some hard-to-explain miracle, I was able to afford DM 1000 Amstrad PC 1512 from Germany. The computer was not smuggled as it was once reported in the press. My failed smuggling effort came two years earlier in a quest to get ZX Spectrum. My friends from Zaire were to buy it for me in West Berlin. In the end, I bought second-hand ZX Spectrum in Poland, at a good price, from someone who thought he was selling "just a keyboard".

[![Amstrad PC-1512 DD](https://supermemo.guru/images/thumb/d/de/Schneider_Amstrad_PC_1512_DD.png/537px-Schneider_Amstrad_PC_1512_DD.png)](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/File:Schneider_Amstrad_PC_1512_DD.png)

> ***Figure:** Amstrad PC-1512 DD. My version had only one diskette drive. Operating system MS-DOS had to be loaded from one diskette, Turbo Pascal 3.0 from another diskette, SuperMemo from yet another. Until I had my first hard drive in 1991, my English collection had to be split into 3000-item portions. My 39,000 items had to be kept on 13 diskettes. I had many more for other areas of knowledge. On Jan 21, 1997, SuperMemo World has tracked down that original PC and bought it back from its owner: Jarek Kantecki. The PC was fully functional for the whole decade. It is now buried somewhere in dusty archives of the company. Perhaps we will publish its picture at some point. The presented picture comes from Wikipedia*

My German Amstrad-Schneider PC 1512 was ordered from a Polish company Olech. Olech was to deliver it in June 1987. They did it in September. This cost me the whole summer of stress. Some time later, [Krzysztof Biedalak](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Krzysztof_Biedalak) ordered a PC from a Dutch company Colgar and never got a PC or money back. If this happened to me, I would have lost my trust in humanity. This would have killed SuperMemo. This might have killed my passion for computers. Biedalak, on the other hand, stoically got back to hard work and earned his money back and more. That would be one of the key personality differences between me and Biedalak. [Stress resilience](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_resilience) should be one of the components of development. I developed my stress resilience late with self-discipline training (e.g. [winter swimming](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Winter_swimming), marathons, etc.). Having lost his money, Biedalak did not complain. He got it back in no time. Soon I was envious of his new shiny PC. His hard work and determination in achieving goals was always a key to the company's survival. It was his own privately earned money that helped [SuperMemo World](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_World) survive the first months. He did not get a gift from his parents. He could always do things on his own.

## Simulating the learning process

On Feb 22, 1986, using my ZX Spectrum, I wrote a program to simulate long-term learning process with [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo). I was worried that with the build-up of material, the learning process would slow down significantly. However, my preliminary results were pretty counterintuitive: the progress is almost linear. There isn't much slow down in learning beyond the very initial period.

On Feb 25, 1986, I extended the simulation program by new functions that would answer "*burning questions about memory*". The program would run on Spectrum over 5 days until I could get full results for 80 years of learning. It confirmed my original findings.

On Mar 23, 1986, I managed to write the same simulation program in Pascal which was a compiled language. This time, I could run 80 years simulation in just 70 minutes. I got the same results. Today, SuperMemo still makes it possible to run similar simulations. The same procedure takes just a second or two.

[![SuperMemo makes it possible to simulate the course of learning over 15 years using real data collected during repetitions](https://supermemo.guru/images/thumb/a/ad/Learning_process_simulation.jpg/600px-Learning_process_simulation.jpg)](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/File:Learning_process_simulation.jpg)

> ***Figure:** SuperMemo makes it possible to simulate the course of learning over 15 years using real data collected during repetitions.*

Some of the results of that simulation are valid today. Below I present some of the original findings. Some might have been amended in [1990](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Optimization_of_learning) or [1994](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Economics_of_learning).

### Learning curve is almost linear

The learning curve obtained by using the model of a [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition) process, except for the very initial period, is almost linear:

[![Learning curve for a generic material, forgetting index equal to 10%, and daily working time of 1 minute](https://supermemo.guru/images/3/30/Linear_learning_curve.gif)](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/File:Linear_learning_curve.gif)

> ***Figure:** Learning curve for a generic material, forgetting index equal to 10%, and daily working time of 1 minute.*

### New items take 5% of the time

In a long-term process, for the [forgetting index](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Forgetting_index) equal to 10%, and for a fixed daily working time, the average time spent on memorizing new items is only 5% of the total time spent on repetitions. This value is almost independent of the size of the learning material.

### Speed of learning

According to the simulation, the number of items memorized in consecutive years when working one minute per day can be approximated with the following equation:

> NewItems=aar*(3*e-0.3*year+1)
>
> where:
>
> - NewItems - items memorized in consecutive years when working one minute per day,
> - year - ordinal number of the year,
> - aar - asymptotic acquisition rate, i.e. the minimum learning rate reached after many years of repetitions (usually about 200 items/year/min)

In a long-term process, for the [forgetting index](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Forgetting_index) equal to 10%, the average rate of learning for generic material can be approximated to 200-300 items/year/min, i.e. one minute of learning per day results in the acquisition of 200-300 items per year. Users of [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo) usually report the average rate of learning from 50-2000 items/year/min.

### Workload

For a generic material and the [forgetting index](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Forgetting_index) of about 10%, the function of time required daily for repetitions per item can roughly be approximated using the formula:

> time=1/500*year-1.5+1/30000
>
> where:
>
> - time - average daily time spent for repetitions per item in a given year (in minutes),
> - year - year of the process.

As the time necessary for repetitions of a single item is almost independent of the total size of the learned material, the above formula may be used to approximate the workload for learning material of any size. For example, the total workload for a 3000-element collection in the first year will be 3000/500*1+3000/30000=6.1 (min/day).

[![Workload, in minutes per day, in a generic 3000-item learning material, for the forgetting index equal to 10%](https://supermemo.guru/images/4/41/Workload.gif)](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/File:Workload.gif)

> ***Figure:** Workload, in minutes per day, in a generic 3000-item learning material, for the forgetting index equal to 10%.*

### Optimum forgetting index

The greatest overall [knowledge acquisition rate](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Knowledge_acquisition_rate) is obtained for the [forgetting index](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Forgetting_index) of about 20-30%. This results from the trade-off between reducing the repetition workload and increasing the relearning workload as the forgetting index progresses upward. In other words, high values of the forgetting index result in longer [intervals](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Interval), but the gain is offset by an additional workload coming from a greater number of forgotten [items](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Item) that have to be relearned.

For the forgetting index greater than 20%, the positive effect of long intervals on memory resulting from the [spacing effect](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spacing_effect) is offset by an increasing number of forgotten items.

[![Dependence of the knowledge acquisition rate on the forgetting index](https://supermemo.guru/images/e/eb/Knowledge_acquisition_rate_vs_forgetting_index.gif)](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/File:Knowledge_acquisition_rate_vs_forgetting_index.gif)

> ***Figure:** Dependence of the knowledge acquisition rate on the forgetting index.*

When the [forgetting index](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Forgetting_index) drops below 5%, the repetition workload increases rapidly (see the figure above). The recommended value of the forgetting index used in the practice of learning is 6-14%.

[![Trade-off between the knowledge retention (forgetting index) and the workload (number of repetitions of an average item in 10,000 days)](https://supermemo.guru/images/5/5a/Knowledge_retention_vs_workload.gif)](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/File:Knowledge_retention_vs_workload.gif)

> ***Figure:** Trade-off between the knowledge retention (forgetting index) and the workload (number of repetitions of an average item in 10,000 days).*

In later years, the value of the optimum [forgetting index](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Forgetting_index) was found to differ depending on the tools used (e.g. [Algorithm SM-17](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Algorithm_SM-17)).

For example, using the model of intermittent learning, I argued that the optimum might fall in 5-10% range:

[![Workload-retention trade off derived from the model of intermittent learning](https://supermemo.guru/images/thumb/1/1e/Workload-retention_tradeoff.jpg/600px-Workload-retention_tradeoff.jpg)](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/File:Workload-retention_tradeoff.jpg)

> ***Fig. 11.2. Workload-retention trade-off:*** *On one hand, if forgetting index is lower than 5%, then the workload increases dramatically without substantially affecting the retention. On the other, above forgetting index of 10%, workload hardly changes while retention steadily falls down. Obviously, the workload-retention trade-off corresponds directly to the compromise between the acquisition rate and retention. By increasing the availability of time X times (by decreasing the workload X times), one can increase the acquisition rate X times (compare Chapter 5). Note, that the relation of the forgetting index and retention in this model is almost linear.* (source: [Optimization of learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Optimization_of_learning): *Model of intermittent learning*, [Piotr Wozniak](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak), 1990)

### Memory capacity

My models of learning made me pretty pessimistic about the maximum lifetime capacity of human memory. By 1990, I stated I doubt I will ever see anyone with over million [SuperMemo items](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Item) in memory (assuming SuperMemo-level recall):

The maximum lifetime capacity of the human brain to acquire new knowledge by means of learning procedures based on [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition) can be estimated as no more than several million [items](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Item). As nobody is likely to spend all his life on learning, I doubt I will ever see anyone with a million items in his memory
