# Introduction

## True history

The pop version of the history of [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition) is full of myths and falsehoods. This text is to tell you the true story. The problem with spaced repetition is that it became too popular for its own effective replication. Like a fast mutating virus it keeps jumping from application to application, and tells its own story while accumulating errors on the way.

## Who invented spaced repetition?

This is the story of how I solved the problem of forgetting. I figured out how to learn efficiently. Modesty is a waste of time, therefore I will add that I think I actually know how to significantly amplify human intelligence. In short: memory underlies knowledge which underlies intelligence. If we can control what we store in memory and what we forget, we can control our problem solving capacity. In a very similar way, we can also amplify artificial intelligence. Its a great relief to be able to type in those proud words after many years of a gag order imposed by commercial considerations.

Back in the early 1990s, I thought I knew how to turn education systems around the world upside down and make them work for all students. However, any major change requires a cultural paradigm shift. It is not enough for a poor student from a poor communist country to announce the potential for a change. I did that, in my [Master's Thesis](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Master's_Thesis), but I found little interest in my ideas. Even my own family was dismissive. Luckily, I met a few smart friends at my university who declared they would use my ideas to set up a business. Like Microsoft changed the world of personal computing, we would change the way people learn. We owned a powerful learning tool: [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo). However, for [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo) to conquer the world it had to ditch its roots for a while. To convince others, [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo) had to be a product of pure science. It could not have just been an idea conceived by a humble student.

To root [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo) in science, we made a major effort to publish our ideas in a [peer-review journal](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/ANE1994), adopted a little known scientific term of "*spaced repetition*" and set our learning technology in a context of learning theory and the history of research in psychology. I am very skeptical of schools, certificates, and titles. However, I still went as far as to earn a PhD in [economics of learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Economics_of_learning), to add respectability to my words.

Today, when [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition) is finally showing up in hundreds of respectable learning tools, applications, and services, we can finally stake the claim and plant the flag at the summit. Usership is going into [hundreds of millions](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Exponential_growth_of_the_popularity_of_Algorithm_SM-2).

If you read SuperMemopedia [here](http://supermemopedia.com/wiki/Who_invented_spaced_repetition?) you may conclude that *"Nobody should ever take credit for discovering spaced repetition"*. I beg to disagree. In this text I will claim the full credit for the discovery, and some solid credit for the dissemination of the idea. My contribution to the latter is waning thanks to the power of the idea itself and a growing circle of people involved in the concept (well beyond [our company](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_World)).

## Perpetuating myths

It is [Krzysztof Biedalak](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Krzysztof_Biedalak) (CEO), who got least patience with fake news in reference to [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition). I will then credit this particular text and the effort in mythbusting to his resolution to keep the history straight. SuperMemo for DOS was born 30 years ago (1987). Let's pay some tribute.

If you believe that [Ebbinghaus](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Ebbinghaus) invented [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition) in 1885, I apologize. When compiling the [history of SuperMemo](http://super-memory.com/english/history.htm), we put the name of the venerable German psychologist at the top of the chronological list and the myth was born. Ebbinghaus never worked over [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition).

Writing about history of [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition) is not easy. Each time we do it, we generate more myths through distortions and misunderstandings. Let's then make it clear and emphatic. There has been a great deal of memory research before [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo). However, each time I give prolific credit, keep in mind the words of [Biedalak](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Biedalak):

> If [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo) is a space shuttle, we need to acknowledge prior work done on bicycles. In the meantime, our competition is busy trying to replicate our shuttle, but the efforts are reminiscent of the [Soviet Buran program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buran_(spacecraft)). Buran has at least made one space flight. It was unmanned

This texts is to put the facts straight, and openly disclose the early steps of [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition). This is a fun foray into the past that brings me a particular delight with the sense of "mission accomplished". Now that we can call our effort a global success, there is no need to make it more respectable than it really is. No need to make it more scientific, more historic, or more certified.

[Spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition) is here and it here to stay. We did it!

## Credits

The list of contributors to the idea of [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition) is too long to include in this short article. Some names do not show up because I simply run out of allocated time to describe their efforts. Dr Phil Pavlik got probably most fresh ideas in the field. An array of memory researchers investigate the impact of spacing on memory. Duolingo and Quizlet are leading competitors with a powerful impact on the good promotion of the idea. I failed to list many of my fantastic teachers who inspired my thinking. The whole host of hard-working and talented people at [SuperMemo World](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_World) would also deserve a mention. Users of [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo) constantly contribute incredible suggestions that drive further progress. The reward for the most impactful explanation of [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition) should go to [Gary Wolf](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Gary_Wolf_on_the_history_of_spaced_repetition) of Wired, but there were many more. Perhaps some other day, I will have more time to write about all those great people in detail.
