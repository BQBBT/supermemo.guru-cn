# 学校教育对学习内驱力的影响

强制性的学校教育抑制了学生的学习内驱力，降低了学生的长期学习效果。

## 学习内驱力 与 年龄

**学习内驱力是中枢神经系统适应发展的重要本能**。婴儿在他们的环境中寻找新奇的元素。这是一种寻找和发现值得学习的东西的方法。婴儿可以在头上的空间里随机搜索，直到找到一个移动的物体。这个物体可以归类为新奇的东西，孩子可以从中学到东西。在发育的某一阶段，婴儿会品尝周围所有的东西，以便了解什么是可以吃的。一个孩子在一屋子玩具里，会把注意力集中在一件玩具上，他认为这是最能满足年轻心灵好奇心的玩具。[学习内驱力](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive)是一种强大的大脑机制，给婴儿们贴上了[永不停止的完美学习机器](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_baby_brain_does_not_work)的标签。
一些科学家认为，随着年龄的增长，我们自然地就失去了求新的欲望和[学习内驱力](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive)。这种说法是危险的错误。确实有许多下降的迹象。成年人不再对所有会动的东西着迷。他会觉得一屋子玩具很无聊。他会吐出未尝过味道，经常讨厌新菜。从来没有吃过蜗牛或甲虫的人不太可能喜欢吃蜗牛或昆虫做的菜。对于渴望知识的年轻学生来说，这个世界是很典型的，但年长者不再对这个世界感兴趣。随着年龄的增长，年长者的热情似乎在稳步下降。

理解学习[内驱力](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive)和它被认为随着时间推移而下降的机制是[优化教育](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Optimization_of_education)的关键。

Understanding the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) and the mechanism by which it supposedly declines over time is essential for [optimizing education](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Optimization_of_education)

## 学习内驱力 与 知识

**随着年龄的增长，削弱学习内驱力的主要因素是已有的知识。**还有一些次要因素，如(1)当前知识的“吸引力”下降，(2)大脑的实际老化。老化可能会导致神经网络的老化、突触削减、精神活力的减少等。这些都可以通过精神保健和学习本身来预防。[学习内驱力](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive)和热情可以一直保持到百岁。在健康的生活方式中，保持大脑的活力比保持运动系统的活力更容易。

一些求新欲可能是发育过程的一部分(例如，婴儿的品味探索阶段)。然而，这些过程并没有在我们试图引导年轻一代在教育课程中进行的探索中发挥重要作用。

知识本身就是学习内驱力最强大的[灭火器](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive)。这可以用我们对某本书的兴趣来说明。一本书初读时很有趣。我们很少有兴趣把这本书再读一遍。重读我们所知道的东西很少令人兴奋。随着时间的推移，在遗忘的作用下，这本书可能会再次变得有趣。被遗忘的书可以通过学习内驱力引导系统重新激活奖励回路。一旦知识建立起来，就失去了寻找新知识的动力。遗忘在其他方面也有帮助，比如收音机里一首歌的情绪影响。不同之处在于，音乐与陈述性记忆的关系要小得多，而与模式和美感的关系要大得多。就像美丽的日落。你不需要忘记一次日落去爱另一次日落。这就是为什么一首朗朗上口的曲子即使多次重放也能让人上瘾，而一首爵士或古典名乐即使不被反复播放，也能让人永生难忘。

知识会破坏新鲜感。没有一个追求新奇的大脑中枢会随着年龄的增长而衰退。在开发过程中没有启动过新奇的灭火程序。一旦无知的领域被填满，知识领域的新奇感就会消失。

知识的增加会破坏求新欲。神经中枢随着年龄的增加不会削减一个人的求新欲。 这种求新欲也不会随着一个人的发展而泯灭。 但当一个人在某一个的知识领域的无知被填满后，他的求新欲也随之消散

我们对[学习内驱力](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive)的理解带来的好消息是，学习内驱力可以在终生的激情教育中起作用。80岁的时候学习和15岁的时候一样有趣。

## 学习内驱力 与 学习

保持学习热情的主要技巧是不断学习本身。学习使大脑充满新知识。然而，它也识别和扩大了不懂的领域。通过选择合适的学习材料，我们可以不断地寻找新的领域来填补。这是[自主学习](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_history:_school_vs._self-directed_learning)的最佳方式。只有学习者自己才能有效地识别出知道的领域、不懂的领域以及中间适合学习的领域。

在学校的学习通过夺去学习内驱力引导系统的控制，违反了有效学习的原则。在学校被动学习往往会触及已知的知识领域，这将使它变得无聊。它常常会触及不懂的领域，使之难以理解。它很少能准确地触及到那些可以从已有的知识树中扩展出去的新知识。

**学校的被动预编课程学习会抑制学习内驱力。**

打个比方说，老师把一段段知识扔给学生，希望他们能从中学到一些东西。通常情况并非如此。大多数课件材料在一个月内就用完了。一年后，只有重复、复习、重复和考试才能帮助部分知识在大脑中保存下来。基于[学习内驱力](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive)的[自主学习](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_history:_school_vs._self-directed_learning)在拒绝不合适的知识或找到可以从已有的知识树中扩展出去的新知识方面是非常精确的。

这是学校教育的最大弊病之一:学生们总是抱怨学校太无聊或太辛苦。学生们不快乐，这与系统背道而驰。如果我们保持旧的课堂学习制度，这个问题就不能被有效地解决。在一个总是因为不同的激情、不同的兴趣、不同的天赋、不同的学习速度而导致知识差异的群体中，优化学习是不可能的。唯一有效的优化解决方案是[自主学习](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_history:_school_vs._self-directed_learning)。

## 老师的困境

一个善意的老师在促进自主学习的同时，也可能抑制学习内驱力。

如果一个孩子有一个问题“纽约在哪里?在哪个国家?”，父母或老师的自然本能是提供答案。如果孩子经常面对同样的问题，她将能够自己回忆起答案。否则，她将再次需要帮助。这种复习的整体效果类似于 SuperMemo 中的复习，只不过它是自然产生的，没有与计算机交互的额外成本，而且它是随机产生的，没有优化每次复习的记忆效果。这种互动对学习内驱力既有抑制作用又有增强作用。随着事实逐渐被记住，人们对纽约作为美国一部分的兴趣也会逐渐减退，即不再是新鲜事。对美国相关事物的兴趣可能会随着对纽约兴趣的增加而增加。对纽约相关事物的兴趣可能会与对美国的兴趣成比例增加。

If a child has a question *"Where is New York? In which country?"*, a natural instinct of a parent or teacher is to provide the answer. If the child is exposed to the same question frequently enough, she will be able recall the answer on her own. Otherwise, she will need help again. Overall effect of such review would be similar to review in [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo), except it would come naturally without the extra cost of the interaction with a computer, and it would come in a random manner without optimizing for the memory effect of each review. This type of interaction has both suppressive and enhancing effect on the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive). The interest in New York as part of the USA will gradually decline as the fact becomes known, i.e. no longer new. The interest in things related to the USA may increase in proportion to the interest in New York. The interest in things related to New York may increase in proportion to the interest in the USA.

当孩子没有从老师那里得到及时的反馈时，就会发生更有趣的互动。这个问题可能仍未得到解答，知识也不会增加。然而，所有没有得到即时回应的问题都有助于学习动力。纽约的位置仍然是个谜，每次曝光都会让它变得更加有趣。兴趣的增加将沿着与控制长期记忆稳定性的增加相似的公式进行(正如两部分模型所预测的那样)。兴趣稳定性的提高并不会对知识产生立竿见影的贡献，但会对学习动力产生强大的影响。孩子会好奇地探索和发现自己在一个竞争的过程中，所有感兴趣的领域将竞争的孩子的焦点，这将是上下文依赖。例如，在生物学的背景下，纽约甚至可能不会在记忆中被点亮。然而，在地图检查或地理纪录片的背景下，这个问题可能会再次出现，并推动进一步的探索。一旦孩子找到了一个热门问题的答案，即一个相对重要程度较高的问题在记忆中燃烧稳定，学习的奖励就会被放大。学习的乐趣增加了。奖励在联想记忆中传播，并增强了与了解纽约、了解美国以及了解与这两者有关的事物有关的积极联想。这是一个奖励传播级联，其深度取决于奖励的水平和原始的好奇心程度。这种级联涉及到内存整合。通过这种方式，通过不回答问题，老师可以潜在地增加记忆网络中更大区域的巩固。根据定义，这减少了在整个学习过程中复习知识的需要。

A far more interesting interaction occurs when the child **does not** receive an instant feedback from a teacher. The question may remain unanswered, and knowledge will not increase. However, all questions asked that get no instant response contribute to the learn drive. The location of New York remains a mystery, which will get more interesting with each exposure. The increase in interest will progress along formulas similar to those that govern the increase in [long-term memory stability](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_stability) (as predicted by the [two component model](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Two_component_model_of_memory)). The increase in stability of interest does not have an immediate contribution to knowledge, but it has a powerful impact on the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive). The child will be curious to explore and find out on its own in a competitive process where all areas of interest will compete for child's focus that will be context dependent. For example, in the context of biology, New York might not even light up in memory. However, in the context of map inspection, or a geographic documentary, the question may pop up again and drive further explorations. Once the child finds answers to a burning question, i.e. a question with a high degree of relative importance burnt stable in memory, the reward of learning becomes magnified. The pleasure of learning increases. The reward propagates in associative memory and enhances positive associations related to knowing New York, knowing the US, and knowing things related to both. This is a reward propagation cascade whose depth depends on the level of reward and the original degree of curiosity. That cascade involves memory consolidation. This way, by not answering a question, a teacher may potentially increase consolidation in a larger areas of memory networks. By definition, this reduces the need for review of knowledge in the entire learning process.

Providing children with answers to their own questions can also be suppressive for the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive). In contrast, leaving questions unanswered may propel the young brain into rewarding explorations that will feed further progress.

This does not mean we should leave all questions unanswered. There are two factors that should prompt an answer from a teacher:

1. the kid is absolutely crazy to know and his curiosity has been driven red hot. In terms of propagation and consolidation, there isn't much to gain. New branches of learn drive seeds will pop up and prompt further research
2. the question is of highly fundamental nature in that in underlies many other vital pieces of knowledge that may be hard or slow to get on one's own. Fundamental questions are of universal nature and get re-consolidated by the sheer progression of learning into new areas. They simply come up in explorations over and over again

## Learn drive distortions

There are dangers and inherent inefficiencies in the learn drive guidance system. It can easily be tricked into seeing novelty in areas which we would not classify as desirable. For an average student, the game of checkers quickly gets boring. To a sophisticated mind, a game of chess is more fun but it also may easily get boring. To a grandmaster, who can see chess as a colorful pattern of chessboard combinations with mnemonic stories that rival the most interesting book of history, chess may be a never-ending source of fascination. In other words, a chessboard and a few chess pieces can feed novelty seeking system with rewarding stimuli for eternity.

For a teen, a video game can easily employ the trick of a chess game by dragging a young mind into an endless labyrinth of new levels to explore and new combinations of tools or situations that never seem to get boring. With a competitive factor in teams, games can be addictive and dangerous.

In an adult, a passion for his favorite sport may also provide a never ending source of fascinating knowledge. One football league, from year to year, can provide all imaginable combination of outcomes, players, field combinations, strategies, personal stories, etc.

The above means that we cannot bank on [self-directed learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_history:_school_vs._self-directed_learning) to always feed our minds with useful knowledge. Social media thrives on gossip and trivia. Both teens and adults can sink untold hours in Facebook without coming up with useful goods. We seem to never get bored with social interaction and mobile phones keep buzzing with a chatter that satisfies our novelty cravings.

For many kids with talents, [self-directed learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_history:_school_vs._self-directed_learning) is all that is needed to soar. The universal formula for all kids for a drive in the quest for valuable knowledge is **self-directed learning with a dose of trajectory-nudging guidance from any corrector system**. This corrector can come from a parent, from a teacher, or from a peer (incl. older peers). The trajectory corrector needs to be **placed in the optimum push zone** to ensure correct trajectory without upsetting the system. Naturally, there is no better corrector than mature self-awareness with a pinch of self-discipline. An educated adult should understand the need for lifelong learning and understand the right direction for his learning to progress. Ideally, life itself is the best corrector of the learning trajectory.

## School enthusiasm

School suppresses the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) and it may result in dangerous long-term neural adaptation that may skew young personalities for life. I write about it in the [following section](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learned_helplessness_vs._learn_drive).

Personal anecdote. [Why use anecdotes?](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Why_use_anecdotes%3F)

With an amazing regularity, I started all my schools with great expectations and in happy anticipation. That was the case in the primary school, high school, and both my colleges. In all cases, the enthusiasm was gone fast. Often after the first day or the first lecture! However, there were moments when the opposite process occurred. When I was thrown away from one school, on disciplinary grounds, I came to a new one with lowest expectations. This actually helped me rise for a while. With a help of a [good teacher](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Great_teachers_change_the_world), I had a few months of a great school adventure. Similarly, a great teacher or [freedom of self-directed learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_history:_school_vs._self-directed_learning) helped me extract some fun from schools later on. If I was to simulate my own life over and over again in conditions of Polish schools, it would be loss of love of learning most of the time. The opposite happy process is reserved for a lucky few who hit lucky circumstances or lucky own predispositions.

## Powering learn drive with SuperMemo

### Enhancing the learn drive

SuperMemo insert. [What is SuperMemo?](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/What_is_SuperMemo%3F)

The most powerful artificial activator of the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) I know is [incremental learning](http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_learning)

.

 

Spaced repetition

 

in SuperMemo tends to bring up the same old material over and over again.

 

Leeches

 

in learning can poison the fun of review.

 

Incremental learning

 

makes it possible to dose in novelty with the inflow of new material interleaved with the review of the old material. The never-ending consolidation of the

 

knowledge tree

 

provides a constant growth of the "unfinished" leaves. Those act as attractors of novelty. In classical learning, forgetting tends to disintegrate the fabric of knowledge and leads to an asymptotic stagnation of the "surface of the tree". In

 

incremental learning

, that surface keeps increasing providing an ever increasing potential in novelty discovery. If your passion for learning is in decline, consider

 

incremental learning

. Slowly! Alternatively, inspirational reading can play a similar role.

If you encounter a boring or incomprehensible subject at school, you may need to suffer 45 minutes of inaction. In [incremental learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_learning), you can switch subjects in seconds, change priorities, reschedule learning, or suffer the pain of excess complexity in the optimum window of time in hope of finding some fruit of knowledge (see: [Push zone](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Push_zone)). In [incremental learning](http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_learning), you are likely to stay in your comfort zone, enter the [push zone](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Push_zone) on occasion, and stay away from regressive areas that waste your time. A subject that seems too hard today will become easy tomorrow. You do not ever need to suffer complexity in vain. You can venture into the same field once you are ready. In [incremental learning](http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_learning), you optimize your choices using your [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) as a powerful guidance.

[Incremental learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_learning) is the most powerful activator of the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive)

### Stunting the learn drive

SuperMemo insert. [What is SuperMemo?](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/What_is_SuperMemo%3F)

Conversely, the

 

learn drive

 

can be suppressed with

 

SuperMemo

. If the student stops learning new things and only keeps retaining old knowledge in SuperMemo, forgetting will prune all attractive surfaces on the knowledge tree. Only the dry core will remain in SuperMemo. While knowledge maintained with active learning and

 

incremental learning

 

resembles a lively tree full of hungry tendrils, dead knowledge maintained with SuperMemo is like a rejected Christmas tree with ever decreasing number of dried out branch endings. For an advanced learner, the effort that comes with

 

spaced repetition

 

may still evoke the

 

pleasure of knowing

. However, this kind of pleasure is best ignited with the actual use of the learned knowledge. Regurgitating old knowledge with no new material has the same suppressive effect as schooling. Similarly, it undermines the love of learning. If you happen to experience a decline of your love of repetitions, add new value to your collection, and redistribute old material in manageable portions into the future. This should apply primarily to old unused exam material that you retain half-heartedly without a true conviction about its usefulness.

[SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo) with no new material is similar to boring classes at school. Both suppress the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive)

### Learn drive at middle age

Instead of noticing a decline in my own learning passions, I observe the reverse. This is why I violently disagree with researchers who tend to attribute the decline in [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) to chronological age. I employ [incremental learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_learning) to keep my passion for learning alive. I explain how it works for me in a personal note below.

Personal anecdote. [Why use anecdotes?](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Why_use_anecdotes%3F)

I was never too interested in history, in a

 

chapter devoted to self-directed learning

, I explain that my learning can be divided into three stages:

1. learning at school with zero efficiency,
2. learning with SuperMemo with some progress, and
3. employment of [incremental reading](http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_learning) that truly exploded my understanding of history.

This is a good example how a subject that is boring to a teen, given the adverse schooling circumstances, may be re-awakened into a nice passion at middle age.

I was always interested in human biology. Here again I claim to have learned little at school, a lot at home, even more with SuperMemo, and a truly great deal with [incremental learning](http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_learning).

I keep saying "*the greater the clearing the greater the perimeter*". The more I know, the more I know I don't know. Understanding one's ignorance is the best drive for more learning, and the more I know, the more painful the ignorance is. Forgetting plays a role too. I keep getting angry with realizations that even a kid in primary school knows things I do not know. Even a 5-year-old can ask better questions. I think those realizations will keep my passion for learning alive for as long as I retain my solid mental faculties.

As for food tastes, I am not sure how much of that is really programmed into the brain, and how much comes from the same mechanism as knowledge in a conservative brain. After the collapse of the Berlin Wall, I had my first ever chance to taste mussels. I was 28. That's the age when we are supposed to have lost our ability to expand our taste range. When taking in my first nibble, I was pretty sure I would vomit. It felt like torture. I could say to myself a dozen times "*this is just healthy food, many people enjoy it, use your reason, why get emotional...*", it did not help much. I managed to swallow a few pieces and was relieved when my portion was over. However, I did not give up. I tried again. I tried to fit my optimum [push zone](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Push_zone) that got very narrow. If I tried too hard or too early, I would hate mussels for life. If I tried too late, I would have forgotten what I had learned in my first experience. My second take at mussels was a bit more relaxed. I was able to find some nice tastes in there despite suffering a lot. A few months later, I enjoyed mussels as much as anyone introduced to the food at earlier stages. There was no novelty seeking in that experience. However, my tastes have been reshaped. Today, I love mussels. Delicious! Am I really deprived of novelty seeking in the area of foods? Not entirely, I love experimenting with various spices and spice combinations. My friend ate a scorpion in Thailand yesterday, his happy face made me intrigued. If I was in Thailand...

As for boredom, my own professional life is subject to the same mechanisms of saturation and boredom.

As a student, I tried out dozens of programming languages. The more exotic the language the greater the fascination. SuperMemo was developed in Pascal in 1987. Since then I settled on Pascal and stopped my explorations. A cynic would attribute that to aging. My interpretation is different. I use the tool that works best for me. I reserve my exploration time for other things. I do not explore less. I explore differently. My [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) in the area of programming languages has been satisfied, however, my overall learn drive is still pretty hungry.

Like an immature student, I also got bored with spaced repetition and memory saying "

there is not much to learn or discover in the field

". My colleagues, esp. Krzysztof Biedalak and Janusz Murakowski, gave me a tiny corrector push saying "

[The two-variable model of memory](http://www.super-memory.com/english/2vm.htm) could make the algorithm simpler and easier to implement, license, and promote

". Once I started exploring the dried up area, I have discovered a million things I did not know, and re-ignited my passion for spaced repetition. Ironically, the algorithm did not get that much simpler, but the truth is that dead passions can be re-awakened.

## Perpetual learn drive

Passions come and wane. This process is controllable. [Self-directed learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-directed_learning) is the best expression of that control. Spaced repetition helps retain gains from waning passions. This, in turn, helps passion re-awakening in need.

**Love of learning can be suppressed quite effectively, and then it can also be restored and revived**

The process of building up enthusiasm for learning is easily trainable and easily suppressed. There is a strong neural component. Damage done by bad schooling is reversible, and one can go well above his or her original baseline. Some of the original potential, however, may be lost for ever.
