# Mountain climb metaphor

## Education is a mountain to climb

The **mountain climb metaphor** is helpful to understand why the concept of [schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Schooling) is so pervasive despite being highly harmful. The metaphor explains that we cannot improve upon optimization without using optimization tools. The metaphor extends to many areas of life. It extends to many ailments that torment humankind today.

A popular saying says *"hindsight is 20/20"*. However, there is a monumental snag in the process when we reach goals via optimization, and then attempt to lead others to reproduce the feat. Using hindsight, we are tempted to improve upon the trajectory without doing the actual computation that would verify the new trajectory's viability.

Metaphor. [Why use metaphors?](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Why_use_metaphors%3F)

Imagine you climb a mountain. In the process, you look for best paths, possible dangers, time-wasting obstacles, shortcuts, feeding points, cliffs, shelters, rock falls, and so on. Once you find your optimum path, and you get to the top, you may feel euphoric elation. It is only natural that you want to help others reproduce your feat. Let others experience your joy. When you look back from the mountain top, you suddenly realize that your path was tortuous, winding, and complex. From the mountain top, you can see a simpler path that is more of a straight line. You scream to people at the foot of the mountain to let them know your "improved" straight line pathway. Inadvertently, you may lead them into an abyss, deep stream, bear cave, or stray in a densely wooded area with loss of visibility. At the mountain top, it is easy to imagine one knows better. It is easy to forget the pains and troubles of the climb

In [schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Schooling), adults have a distorted version of their own learning path. From the mountaintop it all seems so easy: first the alphabet and counting, then reading and simple calculations, and then a simple straight path to wisdom (see also: [Crystallization metaphor](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Crystallization_metaphor)). This approach nearly never works as intended. In case of schooling, it causes unnecessary torment, and time-wasting all around the world.

A child's brain is different than an adult's brain. For [neurobiological reasons](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Childhood_amnesia), the adult has no way of remembering the difference. The adult cannot empathize with a child's learning process, and must step away to let it [run naturally](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning). The shortcuts proposed by adults are counterproductive. The first thing we should learn at school or in life are the wonders of the world. In terms of the [curriculum](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Curriculum), chemistry should precede the alphabet, physics should precede counting sequences, biology should precede reading. We turn it all upside down, and then poison the chalice by making it all compulsory. In a mix with authoritarian parenting, this is a path to the loss of [love of learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Pleasure_of_learning), [hate of school](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Why_kids_hate_school%3F), hate of people, [bullying](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Bullying), depression, drugs, mental disorders, and more. Kids without freedom make as much progress as inmates in a tough prison: instead of re-socializing, they get worse.

## Hindsight is not 20/20

In terms of [schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Schooling), *"hindsight is blurry while appearing to be 20/20"*. It comes from a typical illusion that affects the post-factum perception of neural optimization, or optimization in general. It comes from the [curse of knowledge](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge). All things that used to be difficult in the past, now may seem simple.

Starting the school from reading and counting is an artifact of adult-centric view of education

Early instruction is the degradation of the beauty of the world to the basic abstract ingredients that are unpalatable to young minds. The ABCs should be a natural consequence of exploratory learning. The kids can quickly discover the empowering value of reading. The elation of first reading is most delicious when it comes from self-discovery. It is nearly impossible to enter the world of computer games without a good number sense. Math is sweetest when it is used as a tool on the way to a great goal. Only math connoisseurs can love math for the math sake. Usually, it takes decades to become a connoisseur.

The never-ending drive to begin academic instruction at ever earlier ages is simply cruel.

Early academic instruction without the consent of the child is inhumane and a violation of a child's rights

## Mountain climb example

### Cultivating childhood passions

The [Mountain climb metaphor of schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Mountain_climb_metaphor_of_schooling) explains how the optimization of education can lead to a blind path of inefficient learning.

The picture below illustrates an exemplary emergence of the illusion of the benefits of schooling. All high achievement in the area of human creativity begin with a passion. The most productive passions begin early in life. The education system has an adverse affect on childhood passions (see: [Childhood passions](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Childhood_passions)). In addition to destroying the love of learning, the impact of schooling on early passions might be one of the worst side effects of the [Prussian education system](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Prussian_education_system).

The example flowchart of passionate and prolific learning begins at the time of watching a Spielberg's movie *"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"* in the early childhood. As of that point, passions and interests spread dendritically and culminate with a PhD in astrophysics. As of that point, graduates are usually free to explore, and their further success depends on knowledge, talent, opportunities, etc. I posit that the survival of childhood passions may be the most important ingredient in further high achievement.

[![Evolving passions: from an ET movie to a PhD in astrophysics](https://supermemo.guru/images/thumb/f/f3/Evolving_passions_from_ET_to_astrophysics.png/600px-Evolving_passions_from_ET_to_astrophysics.png)](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/File:Evolving_passions_from_ET_to_astrophysics.png)

> **\*Figure:** Childhood passions may meander from an ET movie, via YouTube and planets, to various branches of science. They may culminate in a PhD in astrophysics and a career in science. On the way, the child may pick up the alphabet, reading skills, algebra and other necessary basics. The road to knowledge is based on exploratory learning. The joy starts in childhood and, ideally, continues well into the retirement age*

Spielberg's movie may initiate interest in the biological aspects of the extraterrestrial life. This in turn may spark interest in life on Mars. Mars may then extend to an interest in other planets. In modern era, a child can quickly cultivate a passion for planets with YouTube. Through the YouTube recommendation system, it is easy to branch out into many directions, including the interest in general biology and the ABC of physics.

Mixing reality with fiction is a norm at this stage. This confusion is predominantly harmless. Interest in the signs of zodiac might be an example. All contradictions are resolved in the process of neural generalization. This occurs spontaneously. This is part of [knowledge crystallization](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Knowledge_crystallization).

Importantly, all those interests in astronomy and physics can and should occur at preliterate stage and can also contribute to the interest in symbols. This way, instead of the usual curricular approach of early school that begins with the alphabet and counting, the child may being with the interest in star types such as G2V or M3V. This can lead to better knowledge of the letters of the alphabet, and later reading. In [democratic schools](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Democratic_school) with no [curriculum](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Curriculum)reading can emerge at 3 or at 10 depending on the child and his interests. It is always a resultant of a competition and synergy between multiple interests. Knowledge of physics and biology can be based on a good understanding of scientific models. Those can, for example, be cultivated with the assistance of [PhET simulations](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/PhET_simulations).

[Childhood passions](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Childhood_passions) can germinate and branch out in many directions. All they need is a conducive exploratory environment. Passions feed on time, love, and access to knowledge. The latter is pretty easy in the era of the Internet

In children with rich interests, passions can quickly cover many areas of the typical high school curriculum. The coverage may be highly superficial in terms of the specific material. However, only the actual long-term knowledge matters in the comparison. With that in mind, knowledge of [homeschoolers](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Homeschooling)and [unschoolers](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Unschooling) is usually vastly superior in terms of [stability](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stability) and [coherence](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Coherence). This is the kind of knowledge that boasts a high degree of applicability. This is the knowledge that makes the difference in life. Our exemplary student with the ultimate PhD in astrophysics will retain her [childhood passions](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Childhood_passions) and pursue a career, e.g. in science, with zeal and joy.

### Replicating passions at school

The problem may begin when [curriculum](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Curriculum) designers try to trace backwards the development of an expert in astrophysics. It is instantly tempting to skip the ET movie, exoplanets, and ban signs of zodiac as superstitious. YouTube may not be included as it is full of potential distractions. Monothematic focus is the key to the method and a straight path to boredom. First months at school are spent on drilling the letters of the alphabet: 3 days per letter. It is easy to deprive the [curriculum](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Curriculum) from all vestiges of extraneous material that could spark new passions. High volume of learning, high [interference](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Interference), high degree of [coercive learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Coercive_learning), can quickly lead to the loss of the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) via [learned helplessness](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learned_helplessness). Some kids may still enjoy long days devoted to learning the alphabet (e.g. through the talents of the early teacher). Few will retain their love for mathematics by the age of 10. Most will [hate their schooling experience](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Why_kids_hate_school%3F) by the time they are 15. There will always be some time reserved for movies, but the experience can easily be ruined by a tired brain: *"You can watch that movie once your homework is done!"*. Some of the high school graduates may still opt for a career in astrophysics. However, without a true passion, this kind of joyless pursuit in bound to result in fewer breakthrough achievements.

[![Straight line education from the alphabet to a PhD in astrophysics](https://supermemo.guru/images/thumb/d/d8/Straight_line_education_from_the_alphabet_to_astrophysics.png/600px-Straight_line_education_from_the_alphabet_to_astrophysics.png)](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/File:Straight_line_education_from_the_alphabet_to_astrophysics.png)

> **Figure**:When coercive learning based on a curriculum attempts to replicate a success of a child who follows its passions to a PhD in astrophysics, exploratory learning is diminished. It is replaced with linear learning devoid of passion. Knowledge loses on coherence. Comprehension is poor. Poor stability undermines the longevity of knowledge. Career in science is hardly possible. When such career is undertaken, it may be joyless and low on creative fruits

## Parody of the future

If the evolution of the school system proceeds at the present rate in the present direction, we will soon teach newborns to read books about the subject of walking. This will ensure they master the theory of walking before the practice of walking. Overtime, we might even defer actual walking to later ages, or even adulthood. This is what we seem to be doing with independence and creative thinking. We defer all the challenges to the time beyond college. And then we send kids out to the world to sink at the deep end of the pool.

Schooling defers the need for independent and creative thinking till adulthood
