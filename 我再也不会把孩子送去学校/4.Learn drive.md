# 学习内驱力

学习内驱力是大脑用于组织全世界知识的[拼图游戏](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Jigsaw_puzzle)的神经机制。

## 定义

**学习内驱力**这个术语对于证明[学校教育](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Problem_of_Schooling)的低效是必不可少的。

**学习内驱力是大脑寻求新信息的一种自然倾向。**学习内驱力是由大脑中固定的引导系统产生的。该引导系统根据检测记忆存储中的新模式，激活奖励中枢。

## 术语

我有意避免使用好奇心这个术语，这是心理学经常使用的术语。如果不能准确理解学习内驱力的机制，我反对现行学校制度的整个推理就会站不住脚。当我解释为什么我不想使用其他容易被误解的已有术语时，对简单而精确的术语的需要将变得更加清晰。

好奇、猎奇、无聊易感性、经验开放性、认知需求和智力投入等术语经常被用于不同的上下文中，以暗示学习内驱力的存在。它们要么是误导，要么意味着不同的东西。他们都有一个包袱，可能会使这个概念模糊不清。这包括几十年来在科学、流行用法、不恰当内涵等方面的分歧。

描述学习内驱力所需的条件:

- 学习内驱力是与生俱来的(即我们生来就有学习内驱力)

- 学习内驱力是可以训练的(即可以通过学习来增强)

- 学习内驱力可以被抑制

- 学习内驱力不是由压力驱动的

- 学习内驱力会带来回报

- 学习内驱力不是一种性格特征(即我们都表现出学习内驱力，至少在儿童时期)

Learn drive is a vital evolutionary adaptation and [employs information entropy](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learntropy) to make judgements about the environment and internal inputs. Most of all, **learn drive is a highly desirable property of the human brain**.

In terms of neural networks, the learn drive can be run by very simple mechanisms that may produce a family of similar trajectories for exploring the environment. If you plot the movements of a toddler in a new environment, you may find it hard to distinguish from a graph generated by a cockroach. However, the ultimate memory effect is wildly different.

The term **curiosity** could be used instead of the learn drive. It has a precise scientific definition but it also has negative connotations in popular use. The learn drive is wholly positive. The learn drive is the instinct that makes humans land on the moon. We say "*curiosity killed the cat*". A Polish proverb says "*curiosity is the first step to hell*". I say "*curiosity is the first step to knowledge*". We use terms like "*morbid curiosity*" or associate curiosity with an older lady cranking her neck out of the window to suck in the latest gossip. Curiosity has also been tainted by its association with motivation and reward. Kids may be curious about what time a candy shop will open. This type of curiosity can be induced without the learn drive. Grades in schooling can generate "curiosity" that **will not** propel a child to greatness. The learn drive is information-based and is less likely to lead to a blind alley. The term *curiosity drive* could serve the role of the learn drive if it was based on a confirmed theory and defined precisely as omnipresent (rather than generated by uncertainty). Throughout this article I explain that we need to cherish and foster the learn drive in education. I hear this often: *curiosity can wait, learning is a priority*. There is no such ambiguity with the term *learn drive*. If I kept saying "*we need to foster curiosity*", nobody would take it seriously!

**Boredom susceptibility** or **boredom intolerance** is very close to the learn drive, however, it implies impatience. It is a repulsive force while the learn drive is based on hunger for new knowledge. Both may be based on the same mechanism, but this article needs to focus on the positive aspect of the learn drive. Substitute learn drive in my texts with boredom susceptibility and you will see a dramatic change in connotations.

**Openness to experience** is a personality trait. It might equally well be defined as the ability to control fears generated by explorations sparked by the learn drive. All people experience the learn drive but some will have it suppressed by situational anxiety.

**Disposition to seek knowledge** is a rare term that has never been properly defined. It is used by experts such as [Dr Lilian Katz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilian_Katz). The term is pretty fitting, however, it is inconveniently long and *disposition* is far less accurate than *drive*. *Drive* is better at expressing the innate nature of the phenomenon. In addition, *knowledge seeking* is a term often used in the field of information retrieval.

**Need for cognition** as the name implies is wider than the learn drive. Playing checkers may satisfy one's need for cognition, but it may easily fail to satisfy the learn drive. The term *need for cognition* overlaps with a subset of curiosity labelled *intellectual curiosity*. Both fail to precisely cover the conditions listed for the learn drive.

**Novelty seeking** is a concept widely used in psychology and behavioral science. It is often confused with curiosity. However, its right place is with the trait theory. Novelty seeking correlates with impulsivity and thrill or sensation seeking. It is then seen as a trait that may lead to behavioral problems. In contrast, the learn drive is the purest of human needs that makes us inventors and discoverers. Novelty seeking is part of [Cloninger's model of personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperament_and_Character_Inventory). In some personality tests it is part of extroversion. It is hereditary, associated with dopamine receptors, and it might send you on a trip to Mt Everest. It might be associated with drug abuse. Mixed reports on correlation with [D4 receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_receptor_D4) gene have been interpreted as lack of consensus between psychologists on what novelty seeking actually is. The learn drive is universal, it is innate, but it is also highly dependent on the status of memory, i.e. it is shaped by experience.

## Novelty and stress

In a lab, rats can be scared into novelty seeking. When a rat senses the smell of a predator, it will double its efforts to find a novel way out of its environment. This behavior shows a possible confusion between the innate drive and the induced drive. Rats behavior will depend on the balance between novelty seeking and the fear of risk. In other words, it is a balance between the search for the new and the fear of the new. One might wrongly use such rat experiments to conclude that kids might be scared into learning. The opposite is true. [Chronic stress is one of the prime destroyers of the brain](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_resilience). It is a prime enemy in development, and prime suppressors of the learn drive. We then have a confusion between novelty seeking (behavior) and novelty seeking (instinct). Some procedures may increase the behavior without changing the instinct. You may scare an animal into novelty seeking (increase in behavior) while actually suppressing the instinct in the long term (instinct suppression). The attraction to the new and the fear of the new will always be present. In optimization of education, we need to focus on the attraction part, and eliminate the fear part. The learn drive is part of the attractive force in novelty seeking.

Anxiety may suppress or enhance exploration. If a child fears dark woods, its explorations will depend on whether it is in the woods (enhanced exploration), on its edge (inhibited exploration), or away from the woods (uninhibited exploration powered by the learn drive). **In education, we want to maximize the learn drive and minimize anxiety**.

The learn drive is a natural instinct to acquire new knowledge. It is present in all healthy students. It is a good force that changes the world.

## Suppression of the learn drive

**Boredom** can now be redefined as the absence of reward from the learn drive system. A healthy brain will resist boredom, and perceive it as a penalty. Children at school are gradually conditioned to tolerate boredom via the mechanism of [learned helplessness](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learned_helplessness_vs._learn_drive).

I will try to show how we systematically undermine the learn drive by [the way we treat newborns and toddlers](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Baby_management). We continue the process by employing low-quality daycare, and ultimately destroy the learn drive by means of compulsory schooling. By the time of high school graduation, the learn drive will often have already been entirely ravaged and vestigial. This is often wrongly attributed to the process of aging or even natural development. This is a dangerous falsehood. **The learn drive can power a septuagenarian as much as it powers a 7-year-old**. I will explain how.
