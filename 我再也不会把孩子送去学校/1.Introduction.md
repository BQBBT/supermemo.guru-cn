# Failure of schooling

Instead of educating, these days schools do a lot of damage to many children. The school was to be the tool of new Renaissance, or new Enlightenment. It has become a tool of oppression that deprives kids of freedom and the love of learning.

Education systems around the world follow the same wrong design that needs to be abolished. This book provides a suggestion how this might be done with minimum side effects.

While dreaming about the [Grand Education Reform](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Reform), I took an unusual approach: instead of talking to adults, I mostly talked to kids. Moreover, I hope to have teen folks as my main target audience. My texts are hard, but they are easier for a smart kid who already knows and feels exactly what I am talking about.

I do **not** believe I will convince many parents, educators or authorities. I primarily hope for kids to start the revolution from the bottom up. Kids are more open, and they understand their own problems better. Moreover, given a bit of love, they are more likely to convince their own parents than I am.

# Scrapping the school system

I have spent over two decades in the school system, three decades working in the field of memory and learning, and my whole life learning on my own. The contrast between schools and [self-directed learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-directed_learning) is so stark that I wake up daily in disbelief about the survival of the [old Prussian factory school model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_education_system). The main thesis of this article is that schooling is the thing of the past. The future will be based on [free learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning). Before humanity is taken over by artificial intelligence, there is still a lot of room for progress. The human brain has an amazing potential. These days, most of that potential is wasted at school. There is no denying that schools have changed the world for the better. The same can be said about the combustion engine. However, these are the days for scrapping the old technologies and the old systems. It is time for a change.

# Brain-based reform

Employing the principles of neuroscience, this [book](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Problem_of_Schooling) explains from grounds up how learning occurs, how it can be made dramatically more effective, how schools counteract effective learning, and how this can be remedied with a universal school [reform](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Reform).

# Love for children

Most of my texts bring up old truths that have been reiterated by dozens of great educators and writers of the past and present. You will find echoes, in no particular order, of [Gray](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Peter_Gray), [Holt](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/John_Holt), [Greenberg](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Danny_Greenberg), [Mitra](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Hole_in_the_wall), [Robinson](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Ken_Robinson), [Locke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke), and dozens of others. I amplify the writings of giants with a bit of neuroscience and my own research into efficient learning. See: [My qualifications](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Problem_of_schooling:_My_qualifications).

True giants of educational thought had one thing in common: deep and unadulterated love of children. Many started their journey by setbacks in their own educational efforts as parents or teachers. They all based their thinking on detailed analysis and observation. They did not analyze test scores. They observed and consulted children.

**What makes a great educator is love for children as opposed to the infatuation with what they might become**

Some of the concepts in this [book](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Problem_of_Schooling) are unique and I credit those to my three decades involvement in [free learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning) based on [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition). The work of giants has been extended with a bit of research on memory, sleep, creativity, and problems solving.

I would like to believe that I care about kids no less than Gray or Holt, but I also bring an extra agenda that might be missing in their work: I am looking for a formula for mass-production of little Nobel Prize winners, researchers, engineers, and creative problem solvers. The good news is that this formula aligns perfectly with [free learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning)philosophy for there is no true genius without true freedom. In other words, my departure from unadulterated love to the business of education is a minor one, and no kid shall ever be hurt by that deflection. Just the opposite, pure love that brings up a healthy and productive child is love fulfilled.

# Executive Summary

This book is too long. You can best consume it with [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading). If this is still too much, go to the [summary](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Summary) and follow the links to things you disagree with. The ultimate summary is that **schooling undermines the brain potential carried by the young generation**. We can do far better. Not 20% better, not 200% better, far more! I include some numbers in the text.

# Kids are not adults in minature

An important thing to keep in mind when designing a perfect education ecosystem is that a child's brain works according to entirely different rules than an adult's brain. We need to set kids free and never forget that our brains differ, our memories distort the past, and that the kid knows his or her own brain better!

The key to resolving the problem of adults being unable to empathize with kid's brains is the appreciation of the power of the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive)and the importance of the [fundamental law of learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Fundamental_law_of_learning). In simplest terms, it can be shown in strictly scientific terms that [pleasure is an inevitable outcome of efficient learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Pleasure_of_learning).

We need to provide kids with conditions for a flourishing [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive)that underlies [self-directed learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-directed_learning). [Free learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning) is based on learning skills. Learning at school is a passive process. This passivity stunts vital skills and habits used in efficient learning. Freedom is essential in decision-making, which is a starting point for developing the necessary skillset.

# Fundamental law of learning

Adults claim that kids hate school because they are ignorant of its benefits. They say: "*Children cannot see far enough*". As a result, old folks believe that learning should be imposed in the name of grand educational goals. This might be #1 myth that underlies the concept of schooling. This is extremely dangerous because of the circular feedback between goals and knowledge valuations. As goal valuations are knowledge-based, they cannot be imposed extrinsically. At the same time, acquisition is knowledge-based. Consequently, all learning is incremental. This means that the opposite is true to what many adults believe: **kids are best evaluators of what knowledge fits their current knowledge model**.

Metaphorically speaking, if we want kids to get to Mt Everest, we may hint of its existence, but [we cannot push the child in a straight line to the summit](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Mountain_climb_metaphor). Instead, the kid needs to incrementally find her way up by looking for the best options from her current position. We cannot scream instructions from the hills because it is the kid who can see best which stone is a threat and which path provides best opportunities.

The new brain science tells us that there is a [detector of value in the brain](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Knowledge_valuation_network). This detector is vital for top quality learning. It accepts the valuable knowledge that fits into knowledge models and rejects everything else. Schooling around the world, with not a single country exception, largely ignores that detector! By remedying this massive global error, we can increase the value of learning and the quality of knowledge. Due to the compound interest, change in strategy can have hard-to-predict dimensions. This is a massive potential for mankind that lays unused and ready to explode.

# Message to our future selves

The biggest effect of schooling, instead of great learning, is the lifelong impact on the loss of interest in further learning. Instead of teaching kids how to learn, the school conditions children to hate school. However, the school ends, and a far worse side effect remains: hate of learning. Luckily, the human mind is inherently [hungry for learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive), and most people recover in a span of a decade. Upon recovery, the memory will whitewash the past, and adults will attribute their own successes to schooling. This perpetuates the vicious cycle. Adults do not understand kids. They do not even understand their own brains from years before when they were kids themselves. The memory has no way of sending an accurate message to the future. See: [Schools suppress the learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Schools_suppress_the_learn_drive)

# Dangers of early instruction

Early instruction is particularly dangerous. This [book](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Problem_of_Schooling) introduces the concept of [toxic memory](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Toxic_memory), which is monumental for understanding the harm inflicted by schooling. I have seen toxic memories thrive under the impact of [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo). I saw them grow like you see plants or pet animals grow in your household. The faster we send kids to school, the greater the chance of the damage. Many governments around the world are eager to reduce the school age. They have no clue!

# Futility of cramming

Cram schools are particularly dangerous. Not only they damage the kids. They may also provide fantastic short-term returns that dazzle the educators with a lesser understanding of neuroscience. This is why many ambitious educators marvel about copying Korean or Singaporean success. Having corrected for cultural differences, I suggest they should look at the correlation between academic success and future creative achievement. For example, see Nobel Prize per capita rankings where "lazy" UK ranks high as opposed to the Asian giants. An even more convincing example should come from biographies of great geniuses of the past: scientists, inventors, and discoverers. We need to study their [unschooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Unschooling) to understand the principles that lead to growing giant creative brains! There is little or no [cramming](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Cramming) on the path to genius.

# Learning skill impotence

Limited reliance on [self-directed learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-directed_learning) at school is like lack of exercise. It turns the intellect into a lazy slob. Many people hate to exercise because of years of neglect. When they resume at the middle age, at some point, exercise can be so pleasurable that it is rediscovered as truly addictive. The same is true of learning.

We have a boatload of evidence: behavioral, neurophysiological, cultural, anecdotal, etc. that **suppressing individual freedoms** at young age negatively affects creative powers later in life. What might be great for a conformist "harmonious" society of [North Korea](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/North_Korea), or rather helpful in a rural community of an impoverished country, may be highly unwelcome in a high-tech society with an appetite for Nobel-winning achievements in science.

We can track a golden nugget of knowledge from its source to a big discovery. From the moment when the nugget meets the brain to the ultimate reward of a breakthrough. The travel of the knowledge through the brain is hindered by restrictions imposed by schooling at all stages. To see how this happens, read: [Why schools fail](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Why_schools_fail).

**Freedom of learning is the key to developing high skills in knowledge acquisition and creative problem solving.**

# Grand Education Reform

Once we free our own kids to do [free learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning) we need to free the entire education system. Let all types of schools and ideas thrive (see: [Grand Education Reform](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Reform)). The incremental and evolutionary school reform process should proceed with an important goal in mind: all brains on the planet should be set free to pursue [free learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning). After that, barring disaster, only the age of the machines can change the direction of mankind.

# When school is a blessing

Schools can be a blessing. In a small village in post-Ebola Liberia, in a Rio favela, in a 10-house village in Poland, in the Mathare slum, in post-Taliban Afghanistan, or in a poverty trap of immigrant banlieue, a school is a blessing. It may be an escape from poverty, violence, or abuse. It may be a path to an enlightened future. In my vicinity, kids do drugs when they do not go to school. In a village, 15 km away, their prime entertainment is drinking beer in front of the local shop. In that sense, school is shielding kids from the poisonous effects of inaction, inert community, or pathological family.

However, schools are a blessing only early in those few tough circumstances, esp. early in the evolutionary process of a developing school system. After they are a blessing, schools become universal, and then compulsory. And then they evolve into a tool of oppression that optimizes in one direction only: more pressure for better scores. All that oppression comes with best intentions that are driven by ignorance.

At that side of the spectrum, the school is a suppressant of the best qualities of human character. The gifted ones suffer most.

# The Optimization Error

Progress in schooling is measured by grades and test scores. [PISA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programme_for_International_Student_Assessment)tests are the gold standard for international competition. As grading and test scores are largely based on short-term learning for short-term results, we optimize in a highly harmful direction. We optimize for [cramming](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Cramming), not for learning. Much less attention is paid to how much kids actually bring out from school. Perfect knowledge of history on the test day may translate to [vestigial knowledge of history on the last day of school](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_history:_school_vs._self-directed_learning).

If grades and test scores are used in optimization of learning, we arrive at absurd conclusions such as: learning all night is good, evening caffeine is good, [cramming](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Cramming) is better than learning, [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition) is ineffective, and other equally absurd propositions.

To improve schooling we add more material and raise the bar. This pushes kids in the direction of short-term memory, more [homework](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Homework), less [sleep](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Science_of_sleep), less exercise, less [fun](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Pleasure_of_learning), harder suppression of the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive), greater risk of [depression and behavioral disorders](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learned_helplessness_vs._learn_drive). We drive ourselves into a corner! This is a corner of unhappy society!

Adding volume and speed to education to beat the scores is like hoping that adding speed to [speed-reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Speed-reading) will result in better learning. We improve scores at the cost of actual knowledge. Even worse, we improve scores while seriously undermining human creativity and problem-solving capacity.

There is an optimum speed of reading or processing information or learning, and it is specific to each individual. Optimum speed can easily be reached in [free learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning), where it is subject to self-regulation.

The problem with optimization of education is that, ideally, we should make incremental corrections today, and measure the outcomes 30-50 years from now. This is why effective optimization of education must rely on models derived from the learning theory. Luckily, those models produce a relatively simple picture. The brain has been equipped with all tools needed to easily achieve far more than what we today think is possible.

# Fostering diversity

[Homeschooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Homeschooling) provides good grounds for [free learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning). A frequent complaint about homeschoolers and unschoolers is that they are weird or [poorly socialized](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Optimal_socialization). That complain ignores the fact that the opposite of weird is homogenized, faceless, and uninteresting. The opposite of society built on all colors of education and knowledge is North Korea. And for the sake of healthy variety, we need the example of North Korea too. At least to cherish our freedoms and learn a thing or two about what makes people and societies happy.

When I promote English as the unifying language for the world, a friend joked that I might as well promote one brand of beer for the world. I need to stress that we always need to balance standards vs. variety. One language for the world is an essential tool for global communication. Variegated education is essential for knowledge evolution. For an unconstrained growth of human knowledge, we need excellent access to knowledge, excellent communication, and a global language should serve that goal too.

# Death of knowledge

Great people have great visions. However, great visions often fail to materialize and die with their fathering visionaries.

Great ideas about great education have been invented and forgotten and then re-invented or re-discovered over and over again. This has been happening for no less than two millennia now.

Plato, Aristotle, and John Locke have been dead for centuries. [John Holt](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/John_Holt) is dead. Ivan Illich is dead. Urie Bronfenbrenner is dead. So are Raymond Moore and Roland Meighan. They left great books that inspire new generations of educators. Their [golden aphorisms](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Gray:_What_genius_minds_think_of_schooling%3F) are great memes for the web, but they have little impact on education driven by short-term demands of the day. The idea of [free learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning) meets with the resistance of short-term goals worshiped by the majority affected by age's old ailment: short-sightedness.

[Danny Greenberg](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Danny_Greenberg) and [John Taylor Gatto](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/John_Taylor_Gatto) are in their 80s. [Peter Gray](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Peter_Gray) is in his 70s. [Ken Robinson](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Ken_Robinson) will be seventy soon. Even the new kid on the block, [Sugata Mitra](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sugata_Mitra) is past his mid 60s.

I have struggled now for 3 decades promoting [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition) and [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading). Spaced repetition is now slowly gaining popularity among students of languages, and in medical sciences. Incremental reading is still in the starting block. Apart from [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo), only two incremental reading plug-in attempts for Anki have been made. The road ahead is long and winding.

With all those wise brains dead or aging, we still give preference to a form of schooling that was praised and skillfully employed by Hitler or Stalin. We still accept the totalitarian solutions with a good-hearted conviction that they are [good for society](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Ban_on_homeschooling#Fineman).

My [book](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Problem_of_Schooling) will [fail](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Why_is_it_hard_to_explain_an_effective_education_system%3F). If Nobel-winning [Milton Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman) still gets ignored or misunderstood in reference to [school choice](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/School_choice), what are my chances of breaking through the wall of indifference or ignorance? I see some chance in social media and in the power of collective wisdom of homeschoolers, unschoolers, democratic schools, and [free learners](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning) across the globe. I see a chance in the rebellious nature of the enslaved youth.

# Prediction: Death of schooling

Radical dreams of Holt, Gatto, and Illich will come true soon. Not for whole societies though. One job of schooling will likely not end: schools will remain containers for storing kids while parents are at work. For this to change, we would need to take a collective breath, reprioritize, slow down, and take a more creative approach to life. I am not optimistic. The rush will continue.

However, more kids will get homeschooled and fight for changes in the law, more [democratic schools](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Democratic_school) will crop up, more Montessori schools and other freedom-based solutions will become popular. The old-style public school will rule the roost, but freedoms will be expanded by law. Nationalism and national curriculum will be curbed. The explosion of [free learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning) is exponential.

I am glad I am not dead yet. Old Prussian school system will die soon. I wager I will see it happen!
