- healthy [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) is the basis of good learning
- 健康的学习内驱力基于好的学习
- self-directed learning grounds its efficiency in the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive)
- 自我导向学习的效率建立在学习内驱力上
- learn drive innate but is trainable
- 学习内驱力是与生俱来的但是也是可以培养的
- learn drive is universal
- 学习内驱力是普遍的
- learn drive does not need to decline with age, it can be sustained till the end of a healthy lifespan
- 学习内驱力不随着年龄的增长而衰退，它可以持续到健康的寿命结束
- learn drive can be suppressed
- 学习内驱力可以被抑制的
- established knowledge undermines the learn drive
- 已掌握的知识会降低学习内驱力
- compulsory schooling is usually a suppressor of the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive)
- 强制的学校教育常常是学习内驱力的抑制者
- providing children with answers to their own questions can also be suppressive for the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive)
- 回答孩子他们自己提出的问题的答案也可能抑制[学习内驱力](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive)
- low [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) makes schooling an unpleasant experience for most kids
- 低学习内驱力使学校教育成为大多数孩子的不愉快经历
- one of the main goals of any modern education system should be to help [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) flourish
- 任何现代教育体系的主要目标之一都应该是帮助[学习内驱力](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive)蓬勃发展
- best enhancer of the learn drive is rich learning
- 学习内驱力的最佳增强方法是饱满的学习
- [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) corrections within the optimum [push zone](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Push_zone) can improve learning and its direction
- 在最佳[推动区](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Push_zone)内的学习内驱力修正可以改善学习及其方向
- there is a positive feedback loop: learning feeds interest, interest feeds learning (see: [Learning history](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_history:_school_vs._self-directed_learning))
- 这是一个积极的反馈循环：学习产生兴趣，兴趣产生学习（参见：学习历史）

### Self-directed learning

### 自我导向学习

- self-directed learning is efficient due to amplifying the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive), operating within the [push zone](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Push_zone), knowledge generalization, knowledge matching, etc.
- 自我导向学习是一种有效的学习方式，这归因于在增强学习内驱力、在推动区内操作、知识概括、知识匹配等
- self-directed learning is best achieved in conditions of freedom (e.g. in [democratic schools](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Democratic_school), in [homeschooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Homeschooling), or in [unschooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Unschooling))
- 自我导向学习在自由的条件下得到最好的实现（例如在[民主学校](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Democratic_school)、[在家教育](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Homeschooling)或[非学校教育](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Unschooling)中）。
- self-directed learning leads to faster learning and to richer knowledge
- 自我导向学习使学习更快，使知识更丰富
- at societal level, self-learning does not lead to communication breakdown due to convergence of knowledge
- 在社会层面上，自学不会因为知识的趋同而导致沟通中断

### Learning reward

### 学习奖励

- pleasure of learning is a highly reliable indicator of the efficiency of learning (as measured by the total of well-structured long-term memories established)
- 学习的乐趣是衡量学习效率的一个高度可靠的指标（通过建立结构良好的长期记忆的总量来衡量）
- displeasure of boredom is part of the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) targeted at maximized learning
- 厌倦的不快是以最大化学习为目标的学习内驱力的一部分。
- instilling passions in a class of students is [rarely effective](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_history:_school_vs._self-directed_learning)
- 在课堂上灌输激情很少有效果

## Creativity

## 创造力

- [Natural creativity cycle](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Natural_creativity_cycle) can be used to boost creativity and improve problem solving
- natural creativity cycle helps promote positive thinking and optimistic frame of mind
- natural creativity cycle is disrupted by schooling, which severely affects learning
- creativity and focus stand in opposition. Both are desirable and vital (see: [ADHD](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/ADHD))
- classroom focus is maximized by suppression of creativity via [learned helplessness](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learned_helplessness_vs._learn_drive)
- [for most kids, creative processes are largely blocked by teaching, homework, structured activities, and home chores](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Creativity:_abundant_but_suppressed!)
- homogeneous education based on a curriculum is a stumbling block on the way towards future creative breakthroughs
- high creativity can easily produce behaviors that can be confused with symptoms of [ADHD](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/ADHD)
- [ADHD](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/ADHD) may correlate with giftedness
- pranks, rebellions, and disobedience at school are an expression of freedom and may foster better learning

## Sleep

## 睡眠

For a detailed summary see: [Sleep science summary](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_sleep,_good_learning,_good_life:_Summary)

- all efficient human operation requires strict adherence to the demands of the [circadian cycle](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian_cycle)
- efficient learning and creativity requires strict adherence to the demands of the circadian cycle
- in a healthy circadian cycle, [best learning and creativity occur after sleep](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Natural_creativity_cycle), i.e. in the morning or after a [siesta](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Siesta)
- [sleep deprivation](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_deprivation) is one of the main reasons schooling is ineffective
- early school start is one of the main reasons [kids dislike school](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Why_students_hate_school%3F)
- circadian system and sleep patterns develop slowly over the first year of life (see: [Baby sleep](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Baby_sleep))
- [co-sleeping](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Baby_sleep) is a natural way of sleeping and breastfeeding
- waking kids in the morning can have consequences that may last a lifetime
- kids should sleep when they are sleepy, not when we think they should sleep
- [free running sleep](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_running_sleep) is the best form of sleep for children and adults
- sleepiness is a defense against [sleep deprivation](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_deprivation)
- Sleep is not food. You cannot get more in advance and store it for later
- alarm clock is an invention that is bad for health

## Stress

## 压力

- stress is one of chief reasons why schooling is ineffective
- expanding student freedoms is the best way towards reducing stress at school
- bullying is one of the main sources of stress at school and may have highly destructive long-term impact on young minds
- teacher attitudes have a tremendous impact on stress levels at school
- pushing the brain to the limits does not benefit the [evolution of the brain](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Evolution_of_the_brain)

## School

## 学校

### Learning

### 学习

- loss of freedom and excess work are a frequent reason for school hate
- self-directed learning outperforms schooling by an order of magnitude in the efficiency of gaining coherent long-term knowledge (see: [Learning history: school vs. self-directed learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_history:_school_vs._self-directed_learning))
- there is an optimum volume of reading in a learning session that maximized long-term learning outcomes. Teachers who pile up too much, do actual harm to learning itself and, more importantly, to the [love of learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) in the end
- excess volume and excess speed of learning result in a [leaky vessel approach](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/On_the_superiority_of_a_rat_over_a_schooled_human): new knowledge easily displaces old knowledge via [interference](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Interference)
- rigors of schooling may reveal creative personalities as [most disruptive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Creativity:_Asset_or_Burden%3F)
- school schedule design stands in mortal conflict with lifestyle conducive for [learning and creativity](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Natural_creativity_cycle)
- compulsory schooling suppress the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) in kids
- schools can easily produce an illusion of good learning and an illusion of long-term memory
- most kids adapt to the [coercion in schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Coercion_in_learning) via [learned helplessness](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learned_helplessness_vs._learn_drive)
- learned helplessness may lead to problems such as depression, obesity, addictions, risk-taking, aggression, bullying, cruelty, etc.
- as experience shapes the brain, inaction in the wake of learned helplessness is bound to stunt cognitive abilities of children
- most often mentioned reasons for linking school are: friends, physical education, good grades, and very rarely, actual progress in learning

### Homework

### 作业

- morning hours are best for homework, yet most kids do homework late in the evening
- self-directed learning is superior to homework
- trading school hours for homework will increase the efficiency of learning in a large subset of students
- homework amplifies the inefficiency of schooling by re-conditioning of the dislike of learning
- self-directed learning with a correction within a [push zone](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Push_zone) is the best form of "homework"

### Cramming

### 填鸭式

- schooling schedules inevitably lead to cramming
- cramming is bad for memory, mood, and long-term learning outcomes
- schooling conditions the brain to underestimate the value of lasting knowledge and the cost of quality learning
- cramming techniques inspired [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading), which has nothing to do with cramming

### Dropping out

- great people can be found among college graduates and among high [school dropouts](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/School_dropouts)
- genius is incompatible with schooling. This is why there are many high achieving [school dropouts](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/School_dropouts)
- school inherently [suppress creativity](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Schools_violate_the_Genius_Checklist)

### Unschooling

- unschooling provides most freedom to develop powerful [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive), and paradoxically, produce best learning outcomes
- homeschooling, unschooling and democratic schooling resolve nearly all causes of school hate
- ubiquity of information and convergence of knowledge imply that we have fewer reasons to worry about unschooling and/or [free education](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/On_freedom_of_education_and_freedom_of_information)
- unrestrained development of personality may take three decades. Accelerating that process limits human cognitive powers
- education system invest heavily into teaching things people can easily learn on their own (and with [pleasure](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Pleasure_of_learning))

### Reform

- **freedom** in many platforms is the key to effective educational reform
- freedom in education should affect children, students, teachers, educators, parents, innovators, organizers, and more
- adult-centric point of view is one of the driving forces behind the failure of modern education
- changes in brain function from early childhood to adulthood make it virtually impossible for adults to understand child's brain without the help from science (i.e. mostly learning neuroscience)
- mass production of great teachers is no easier than mass production of genius
- grants for students to get to college are as good as grants for students to skip college. All support for the youth is welcome

## Childhood

### Learning in childhood

- children have a [very bad long-term memory](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Childhood_amnesia)
- bad long-term memory in children results from fast growth, and [re-structuring of the brain](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Infantile_amnesia_caused_by_neurogenesis)
- poor declarative memories in children imply that formal instruction should best be delayed until the age of 7-9
- children learn best via self-directed play
- children [rarely recall](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Childhood_amnesia) memories from before the age of 2-3
- children form episodic and declarative memories from birth. The term "[childhood amnesia](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Childhood_amnesia)" refers to rapid memory turnover in childhood
- lifetime survival of early memories depends on (1) memory formation, (2) forgetting, (3) interference, (4) re-wiring, (5) exposure to memorable events, and (6) post exposure review
- earliest memories are often unpleasant (e.g. related to [daycare](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Daycare_misery))
- [stress tends to improve learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_reduces_neurogenesis), and undermine brain growth
- maternal separation [improves memories via stress hormones](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_acceleration_via_stress)
- the myth of children as perfect learning machines comes from their ability to generalize with the use of short-term memory
- children store a lot of information in short-term memory because they spend all their days learning new things
- children can use words and phrases in the long term because they keep relearning things they use often
- [early academic teaching may slow down brain development](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Early_Academic_Training_Retards_Intellectual_Development) and begin a lifelong [hate of learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Why_kids_hate_school%3F)
- kids should **never** be made to learn if they show no interest or refuse (see: [Pleasure of learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Pleasure_of_learning), [Learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive), and [Push zone](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Push_zone))
- early acceleration in development does not need to translate to success in adulthood
- child prodigies often experience burnout at adolescence or early adulthood. This may be an expression of the early peak in development
- overstimulation can best be prevented by letting kids decide their own exposure to stimuli
- slow brain development may result in better long term outcomes (see: [Infantile amnesia caused by neurogenesis](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Infantile_amnesia_caused_by_neurogenesis))
- math and physics geniuses often come from slow or troubled childhood
- development acceleration induced by [daycare](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Daycare_misery) may turn out to be harmful

### Childhood passions

- relentless lifelong pursuit of goals born from [childhood passions](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Passion_and_memory) is a solid formula for success
- minor events in childhood can turn into [lifelong passions](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Passion_and_memory)
- child passions have a dramatic positive impact on the power of the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive)
- child passions should be cherished and protected
- true passions do not need to be stoked up as they serve an inner need
- childhood passions can easily get lost due to preoccupation with schooling
- best formula for helping kids get interested in science by [Neil deGrasse Tyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson) is: "*Get off their back!*"

### Baby care

- we should follow [hunter-gatherer prescription](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Hunter-gatherer_childhood) for child care to maximize development and minimize the whole host of behavioral problems
- [weaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaning) should be natural and may take up to 4 years. In particular, it should not be accelerated for the sake of daycare
- forceful weaning begins the negative process in which child's brain adapts to the environment via [learned helplessness](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learned_helplessness_vs._learn_drive)
- all limits on the freedom of movement, slow down baby development
- for brain development, baby wearing is superior to using strollers
- keeping kids safe with proofing makes it hard to teach them safety
- playing Mozart to a womb is more likely to scare the baby than to produce a music genius
- large [behavioral spaces](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Behavioral_space) with fewer rules are beneficial in cognitive development
- rigid regiment of rules enforced by strangers has a powerful impact on the brain via learned helplessness

### Daycare

- daycare is an inferior substitute of good parenting
- healthy childhood of few concerns without the relegation to [daycare](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Daycare_misery) is the root of future greatness
- in western societies, there is a social pressure to send kids to daycare
- to a large extent, social pressure originates in self-exculpatory mindset of young career-oriented parents
- peer pressure in favor of daycare is based on a series of myths about the biology of child development
- daycare acceleration is often a short-term phenomenon with poorer long-term outcomes
- daycare acceleration works only for kids from families characterized by low resources (incl. time), neglect, pathology, and/or poor education
- daycare boost to immunity is a myth
- daycare socialization is often [negative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialization#Negative_socialization)
- daycare results in an increase in aggression and other behavioral problems
- for many kids, daycare begins too early and necessitates forceful waking
- for most kids, daycare violates [natural creativity cycle](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Natural_creativity_cycle)
- for most kids, esp. young kids, or early in the process, daycare involves significant stress
- for small kids, maternal separation is bad for the brain
- kids suffering from chronic daycare stress are likely to experience inferior long-term brain development
- [learned helplessness](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learned_helplessness) of daycare increases the likelihood of depression in adulthood
- daycare often produces a positive feedback loop: slower development, lower immunity, infections, antibiotics, missed days, more stress, more sleep deprivation, etc.
- potty-training is a waste of time, and can involve unnecessary stress
- all forms of physiological and developmental acceleration make sense only if they are child-driven, i.e. natural

## Socialization

- socialization can be modelled and optimized
- for biological reasons, optimization of socialization is achieved best with minimum intervention
- individualistic socializations serves the good of society along principles similar to market economics
- optimum socialization can be achieved in abstraction of value and in different value systems
- individual personality and values may determine the optimum level/degree of socialization
- socialization is a lifelong learning process
- early socialization should focus on establishing a lifelong learning platform
- coercive socialization may backfire and result in asociality or anti-social behaviors
- [critical periods](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Critical_period) in development make it important to opt against early socialization in [daycare](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Daycare_misery)
- social intelligence might have had a significant contribution to the increase in the size of the human brain
- social intelligence is essential for further progress of mankind on the social platform and well beyond

## Health

- modern [baby management](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Baby_management) results in harmful restrictions in the exposure to healthy natural stimuli
- all forms of medical intervention during pregnancy and birth may have negative impact on health
- moderate exposure to pathogens and allergens is vital for the health of the immune system
- exposure to changes in temperature ensures efficient thermoregulation
- thermogenesis is one of the most powerful body defenses (e.g. against infections)
- [benefits of daycare for immunity](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Daycare_infections) are questionable
- exposure to pathogens is good, sickness is not
- [daycare infections](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Daycare_infections) often produce consequences that last a lifetime
- [daycare infections](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Daycare_infections) often affect entire households
- daycare shifts the burden of disease to younger ages which may have negative impact on long-term cognitive development
- kids in home care are often overprotected, which weakens their immune system
- we tend to underestimate the power of newborns and toddlers to combat infections on their own
- we tend to underestimate the power of innate immunity in combating colds and influenza
- media headlines which claim that home care weakens the immune system are misleading and dangerous
- in most cases, the best care for young kids is provided by their biological mom with support of members of her family
- handling infections one at a time seems to be a safe strategy
- Graham Rook's "old friend" hypothesis implies that we should expose kids to pathogens from natural environments
- daycare provides excessive exposure to particularly dangerous pathogens in conditions of weakened immune system
- respiratory infections are one of the chief destroyers of productivity
- it is possible to avoid infections for decades in otherwise vulnerable individuals
- [good sleep](http://super-memory.com/articles/sleep.htm) is essential for immunity
- alarm clocks destroy the quality of sleep
- winter swimming can be helpful in preventing respiratory infections
- moderate exercise helps prevent infections
- [stress management](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_resilience) is essential for immunity
- rehydration helps combat infections
- healthy diet and lifestyle help combat infections
- it is important to avoid heavy exposure to viruses during epidemics

### Alzheimer's

- the root neuronal cause of Alzheimer's is excitotoxicity, which comes from excessive cognitive loads on networks with insufficient processing power
- good learning is preventive, while bad learning may contribute to Alzheimer's
- the best reassurance for the positive impact of learning on prevention of Alzheimer's is the adherence to the [Fundamental law of learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Fundamental_law_of_learning)
- schooling inherently violates the [Fundamental law of learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Fundamental_law_of_learning) through its coercive nature
- for many kids, schooling leads to neural injury, which may be instantly apparent, e.g. in developing depression
- despite all calls for reforms, mainstream schooling in the western world still keeps evolving in the wrong direction: more haste, more stress, greater loads, less coherence, and more neural injury
- main factors of schooling that lead to excitotoxic injury are: overload, low coherence, high interference, low retention, low [stability](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stability), sleep deprivation, [circadian violations](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Natural_creativity_cycle), [stress](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_resilience), and [toxic memories](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Toxic_memory)
- even though literacy is preventive, bad learning and bad habits taken from school may contribute to Alzheimer's pathology later in life

### ADHD

- a creative and lively child may easily be branded [ADHD](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/ADHD) by parents, teachers, or "well-wishing" strangers
- what a teacher recognizes as [ADHD](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/ADHD) may actually be a sign of giftedness
- schooling provides an ideal breeding ground for ADHD-like problems and symptoms in otherwise healthy kids
- diagnostic criteria for [ADHD](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/ADHD) in DSM-5 (2013) have been relaxed, which may lead to further overdiagnosis
- ADHD may be managed better by understanding the circadian and homeostatic aspects of mental activity
- circadian disruption may amplify symptoms of ADHD, or lead to a wrong diagnosis
- free running sleep is vital for managing ADHD
- before administering medication, e.g. Ritalin, children should be evaluated in free running condition, i.e. away from pressures of schooling (see: [prescription](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/ADHD))
- psychiatric drugs target receptors and neurotransmitters, not specific brain structures. As such they are bound to have [side effects](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Indiscriminate_action_of_psychiatric_drugs)
- schedule designed around the circadian cycle may mitigate all negative aspects of [ADHD](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/ADHD)

## My own experience

- catching a cold was a joyous moment in my young life: I did not have to go to school!
- at high school, I would learn 16 times faster on my own during summer vacation than during the school year (see: [Learning history](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_history:_school_vs._self-directed_learning))
- schools have been extremely efficient in destroying my enthusiasm for schooling (at all levels of education)
- in the course of 12 years, I learned [no history at school](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_history:_school_vs._self-directed_learning)
- in the course of 8 years, I learned [very little English](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Schools_are_useless_in_teaching_English!) at school
- [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo) accelerated my learning in 1987
- [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading) accelerated my learning in 2000
