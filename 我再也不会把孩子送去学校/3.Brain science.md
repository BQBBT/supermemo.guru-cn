The strongest argument against schooling comes from neuroscience. One of the most fundamental forces that can shape education is the **learn drive**. Understanding learn drive is essential for the realization that [self-directed](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-directed_learning), [self-paced](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-paced_learning) [self-learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-learning) is the most efficient way of developing a knowledgeable and creative mind. The neural principles of reward in the learn drive lead me to the formulation of the [Fundamental law of learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/I_would_never_send_my_kids_to_school#Fundamental_law_of_learning). I hope no kid will ever accept any violation of that law.

In addition to inefficient learning, one of the most wasteful offences committed by the system of schooling is the disregard for the [natural creativity cycle](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/I_would_never_send_my_kids_to_school#Natural_creativity_cycle). This is the cycle in which knowledge is acquired, built upon creatively, expanded, and optimized in the course of the [circadian cycle](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian_cycle) in waking and in sleep. School systems have been designed mostly in the 19th century when we did not know of the existence of the creativity cycle.
