# 18 Stress resilience

# 压力恢复力

## 18.1 Good stress and bad stress

## 好压力和坏压力

While scientists speak of the damaging effects of stress on the brain, the concept of stress-free upbringing receives a great deal of scorn in social media. The confusion comes from the failure to differentiate between various forms of stress.

虽然科学家们谈论压力对大脑的破坏性影响，但无压力教育的概念在社交媒体中受到了极大的嘲笑。混淆来自于未能区分各种形式的压力。

Kids who suffer from separation anxiety when dropped in daycare at the very young age provide an example of highly harmful stress. On the other hand, injuries suffered in the football field may be taken as a badge of honor, and an example of good stress that builds resilience. Bad stress will result in loss of brain cells, while good stress may, in theory, have the opposite effect.

在幼儿期间在日托中跌倒时患有分离焦虑的孩子提供了高度有害的压力的例子。另一方面，足球场遭受的伤病可能被视为荣誉的徽章，也是建立复原力的良好压力的一个例子。不良压力会导致脑细胞的损失，而理论上，良好的压力可能会产生相反的效果。

[Attachment parenting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_parenting) is often derided as "stress-free upbringing", while it should rather be seen as a good parenting that indeed helps prevent stress wherever it is harmful for health or brain development.

依恋养育经常被嘲笑为「无压力的抚养」，而它应该被视为一种良好的养育方式，确实有助于预防压力，无论它对健康或大脑发育有害。

## 18.2 Global loss of IQ

## 全球智商下降

[Flynn effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect) says that there is a global increase in IQ from generation to generation. However, there is also a dark force in action that counteracts that positive trend. There is a global loss of brain cells and a global loss of creative power in developed societies. This loss is caused by bad sleep, stress, and depression. We have unleashed forces that keep destroying brains in modern society, and those forces seem to only increase in power from decade to decade. We can counteract those forces by using the tools of neuroscience. We need to start from shielding babies, toddlers, kids, and adolescents from brain-altering influences that shape their future life and leave them defenseless in face of adversity. The younger the child, the more important it is to take the right approach. Mishandling young brain leaves permanent imprints on personality and brain health that may be hard to correct in adulthood.

Flynn 效应表明智商世代相传。然而，还有一种黑暗的力量可以抵消这种积极的趋势。发达国家的脑细胞全球丧失，全球创造力丧失。这种损失是由睡眠不好，压力和抑郁引起的。我们释放的力量在现代社会中不断摧毁大脑，而这些力量似乎只会在十年到十年间增加。我们可以通过使用神经科学的工具来抵消这些力量。我们需要从保护婴儿，学步儿童，儿童和青少年开始，避免影响他们未来生活的改变大脑的影响，让他们在逆境中毫无防御能力。孩子越小，采取正确方法就越重要。处理不当的年轻大脑会留下人格和大脑健康的永久性印记，这可能在成年期难以纠正。

The very first step is the need to **clear up the fog surrounding the myth that exposing kids to stress early will make them more stress resistant later in life**. There is only a tiny grain of truth in that claim, which otherwise is seriously harmful.

第一步是需要消除围绕神话的迷雾，让孩子们尽早承受压力会使他们在以后的生活中更具抗压力。该声明中只有一小部分真相，否则会造成严重危害。

## 18.3 Resistance to chronic stress

## 抵抗慢性压力

From the proponents of rigors of daycare and schooling, I hear it over and over again: "*How will the kid cope as an adult?*" "*Will he tell the boss "I like to sleep long and work 2 hours only?*".

从日托和学校严谨的支持者那里，我一遍又一遍地听到：「孩子将如何应对成年人？」 「他会告诉老板吗？我喜欢长时间睡觉，只工作2个小时？」

[Peter Gray](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Peter_Gray) put it mildly by saying "*some people believe*" in the supposed myth: "*the very unpleasantness of school is good for children, so they will learn to tolerate unpleasantness as preparation for real life*". Gray's soft claim probably comes from the fact that he comes from the culture where homeschooling is exploding. In Europe, the myth of "*trainability of chronic stress resistance" in children is omnipresent.*

彼得格雷温和地说「有些人相信」所谓的神话：「学校的非常不愉快对孩子有好处，所以他们会学会容忍不愉快作为现实生活的准备」。格雷的软声称可能来自于他来自家庭学校正在爆炸的文化。在欧洲，儿童的「慢性压力抵抗训练」的神话无处不在。

The reasoning carries a vicious prescription: expose kids to stress to get them ready for adulthood! [Alfie Kohn](http://www.alfiekohn.org/) mocks it: *Punch the kid today because someone might punch her in the future*.

这个推理带有一个恶毒的处方：让孩子们有压力让他们为成年做好准备！ Alfie Kohn嘲笑它：今天打孩子，因为将来有人会打她。

The myth of trainable resilience is not only the domain of the backward, ignorant, and uneducated. It originates from some research on rats in the 1950s. It permeates well-educated and open-minded families. Amazingly, I hear that even from high-IQ teachers. It all comes from a painful ignorance or misunderstanding of neuroscience. The pernicious myth of beneficial exposure to stress needs to be combated vigorously. It hurts kids around the world, all the time. The thinking goes like this: if muscle stress makes it stronger, if bone stress make it harder, if brain effort makes it smarter, then early waking makes the kid resistant to early waking stress, or maternal separation makes the kid resistant to adversities of life, etc.

可训练的韧性的神话不仅是落后，无知和未受过教育的领域。它起源于20世纪50年代对老鼠的一些研究。它渗透到受过良好教育和思想开放的家庭。令人惊讶的是，我甚至从高智商老师那里听到了这一点。这一切都来自痛苦的无知或对神经科学的误解。需要积极打击有益于压力的有害神话。它一直伤害着世界各地的孩子。这样的想法是这样的：如果肌肉压力使其变得更强，如果骨骼压力使其更加坚硬，如果大脑的努力使其变得更聪明，那么早期醒来会使孩子抵抗早期的清醒压力，或者母亲的分离使孩子抵抗生命的逆境等

The problem is that not all tissues and systems are trainable, and not all degrees of stress bring improvement. It is hard to break natural barriers in height or vision with training. You cannot exercise your teeth to crush diamond or adapt your brain to banging the head against the wall. Excess stress will tear muscles and break the bones. If resistance to [chronic stress](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Chronic_stress)was trainable, we would have [Romanian orphans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_orphans) taking leadership in NASA, or winning in Formula One.

问题是并非所有组织和系统都是可训练的，并且并非所有程度的压力都会带来改善。通过训练很难打破身高或视力的天然障碍。你不能锻炼牙齿来压碎钻石或让你的大脑将头撞在墙上。过度的压力会撕裂肌肉并打破骨骼。如果对慢性压力的抵抗力是可训练的，我们就会让罗马尼亚孤儿在NASA中担任领导，或者在一级方程式赛车中获胜。

**The younger the brain, the greater the possible negative impact of chronic stress.**

**大脑越年轻，慢性压力可能产生的负面影响就越大。**

## 18.4 Adaptation to stress

## 适应压力

When a fighter is to face an opponent in the ring, his body activates a stress response. Fighting is stressful. Stress response helps to fight better. Having spent many hours in the ring, fighters understand risks and dangers better. They know how to avoid punches. Stress level in good fighters is reduced. This is **knowledge-based adaptation to stress**. With experience, fighters understand the game of fighting better. In boxing, top-level competitors may drive this knowledge-based adaptation to the point of actually enjoying the prospect of a risky encounter.

当战斗机要面对戒指中的对手时，他的身体会激活压力反应。战斗压力很大。压力反应有助于更好地战斗。在战斗中花了好几个小时，战士们更好地了解风险和危险。他们知道如何避免拳打脚踢。良好战士的压力水平降低。这是基于知识的压力适应。凭借经验，战士更了解战斗的游戏。在拳击比赛中，顶级竞争者可以将这种基于知识的适应性推向实际享受风险遭遇前景的程度。

There are many ways we can adapt to stress using good practise, habits or procedures. For example, I advocate an approach in which the last 2-4 hours of the waking day are protected from stress. This is the time when the phone should be off and the employee should be protected from the employer (if his particular profession permits such an arrangement). This is the time when reading e-mail should be prohibited. This is the time when job-related investigations should be closed. Surfing on the net should be limited to unexciting or pleasurable areas of interest. Even then it may negatively affect the circadian cycle due to the exposure to blue light.

我们有很多方法可以通过良好的实践，习惯或程序来适应压力。例如，我提倡一种方法，在这种方法中，清醒日的最后2-4小时可以免受压力。这是电话关闭的时间，应该保护雇员免受雇主的侵害（如果他的特定职业允许这样的安排）。这是应该禁止阅读电子邮件的时间。这是应该关闭与工作有关的调查的时间。在网上冲浪应限于令人兴奋或令人愉快的兴趣领域。即便如此，由于暴露在蓝光下，它可能会对昼夜周期产生负面影响。

The stress that should be avoided in the evening, when experienced at mid-day, may have a beneficial impact on the mind and intellectual performance. We would call it [eustress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustress). When timed differently, e.g. before sleep, the stress response may be exaggerated, harmful, or interfere with good sleep. When good habits help avoid or cope with stress, I call it **procedural adaptation to stress**.

在中午经历的夜晚应该避免的压力可能对心灵和智力表现产生有益的影响。我们称之为eustress。如果时间不同，例如在睡眠前，压力反应可能被夸大，有害或干扰良好的睡眠。当良好的习惯有助于避免或应对压力时，我称之为程序性适应压力。

Locke and Rousseau have long understood that exposing a kid to a stress of "*season, climates, elements*" is a good thing. This is not adaptation to stress, it is **physiological adaptation** to environmental stressors. Winter swimming might be stressful, and exposure will result in knowledge-based and procedural adaptations. However, there is also a vital physiological component where physiological adaptation to cold exposure takes away the edge from the stressor.

Locke 和 Rousseau 早就明白，让孩子面对「季节，气候，元素」的压力是一件好事。这不适应压力，它是对环境压力因素的生理适应。冬季游泳可能会带来压力，接触将导致基于知识和程序的适应。然而，还存在一种重要的生理学成分，其中对冷暴露的生理适应带走了应激源的边缘。

Last but not least there is attenuation and learned helplessness. We can adapt to stress by making the brain stop responding to the stressor. Metaphorically speaking, we can damage and silence portions of the brain. Let's call it: **adaptation via injury**. This is what happens in animals deprived of freedom. This also happens in kids whose freedom is taken away by coercive schooling. At some point, coerced learning is no longer stressful. Children become numb and disinterested.

最后但并非最不重要的是，有衰减和学习无助。我们可以通过让大脑停止对压力源做出反应来适应压力。比喻说，我们可以破坏和沉默大脑的某些部分。我们称之为：通过伤害适应。这就是被剥夺自由的动物所发生的事情。这种情况也发生在自由被强制性教育带走的孩子身上。在某些时候，强迫学习不再是压力。孩子们变得麻木无助。

We are all aware of those coping mechanisms. This is why many parents easily fall victim to the belief that exposure to stress is a good preparation for adult life. We can easily get misled by inaccurate hints on **authoritarian parenting**. Williams sisters, Serena and Venus, accomplished the impossible with a seemingly authoritarian father. However, few people notice that this training had actually been guided by talents within. A seemingly strict father can actually capitalize on natural inner drives of kids who propel themselves to excellence with a degree of rigid guidance well-enclosed or approaching the optimum [push zone](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Push_zone). In a similar manner, Laszlo Polgar made his daughters spend inordinate hours over chess. He drove them to the top of the world in chess rankings. It is underestimated that kids must actually learn to love chess in the first place. Such a love and passion are the key to success.

我们都知道这些应对机制。这就是为什么许多父母容易成为接受压力是成年人生活的良好准备的信念的受害者。我们很容易被专制育儿的不准确暗示误导。威廉姆斯姐妹，塞丽娜和维纳斯，用一个看似独裁的父亲完成了不可能的事。然而，很少有人注意到这种训练实际上是由内部人才引导的。一个看似严格的父亲实际上可以充分利用孩子们的自然内在动力，他们通过一定程度的严格指导将自己推向卓越，或者接近最佳推动区域。以类似的方式，Laszlo Polgar让他的女儿们在国际象棋上花费了过多的时间。他在国际象棋排名中将他们带到了世界之巅。低估了孩子们必须首先学会爱国际象棋。这种爱和激情是成功的关键。

Many a parent may be tempted to emulate Williams or Polgar accomplishments in total oblivion of the primary rule: **kids should never be exposed to chronic stress**. Their brains are too young. Their minds are too immature. They cannot effectively employ knowledge-based or procedural adaptation to stress. Instead, they will adapt via [learned helplessness](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learned_helplessness) and their brain growth will be stunted.

许多父母可能会试图效仿威廉姆斯或波尔加的成就完全遗忘了主要规则：孩子们永远不应该受到慢性压力。他们的大脑太年轻了。他们的思想太不成熟了。他们无法有效地利用基于知识或程序的压力来适应压力。相反，他们将通过学习无助而适应，他们的大脑发育将受到阻碍。

There are benefits to eustress, and various forms of "stress" are part of a healthy training and development. However, there are no trainable defences against chronic stress, i.e. the one you get with perpetual sleep deprivation, bullying, maternal separation, child abuse, etc. Those are stresses that change the metabolism, and change the wiring of the brain. They correlate well with an increase in mental disease, behavioral disorders, addictions, etc. Chronic stress is the type of stress you go to sleep with. Characterically, this is the stress that does not go away on waking. Its chronic nature is best expressed by the fact that there is no "*rise and shine*". Chronically stressed kid wakes up with a worry. Chronic stress can persist and gnaw at you for days or weeks. Attenuation can be used to reduce the impact of inevitable stress. Professional training helps stress management in stressful jobs. However, the purpose of those is the prevention of chronic stress, procedural adaptation, or knowledge-based adaptation. Professional training does not provide biological resistance to the effects of chronic stress.

积极压力有好处，各种形式的「压力」是健康训练和发展的一部分。然而，没有可训练的抗慢性压力的防御措施，即永久性睡眠剥夺，欺凌，母亲分离，虐待儿童等等。这些是改变新陈代谢和改变大脑布线的压力。它们与精神疾病，行为障碍，成瘾等的增加密切相关。慢性压力是你睡觉时的压力类型。特点是，这是在醒来时不会消失的压力。它的长期性质最好表现在没有「兴起和光彩」的事实。长期紧张的孩子担心醒来。慢性压力可以持续存在并啃几天或几周。衰减可用于减少不可避免的压力的影响。专业培训有助于在压力工作中进行压力管理。然而，这些目的是预防慢性压力，程序适应或基于知识的适应。专业培训不能对慢性压力的影响提供生物抵抗力。

## 18.5 Preparation for adulthood

## 成年期的准备

### 18.5.1 Stress resilience training

### 压力适应训练

Older psychologists and educators have often been biased by years of analysis of institutionalized children. As a result, they may perpetuate the myth born in the 1950s: "*sour faces in kids are ok because duty and discipline are educational*"! They believe that a well-organized kindergarten group is better than a rowdy sports field crowd of mixed-aged peers. That thinking is directed at preparing the kids to live in the modern adult world.

年龄较大的心理学家和教育工作者经常因为多年来对制度化儿童的分析而产生偏见。结果，他们可能会延续20世纪50年代出生的神话：「孩子们的酸面是好的，因为责任和纪律是教育的」！他们认为，一个组织良好的幼儿园团队比混合年龄段的吵闹运动场人群要好。这种想法旨在让孩子们为现代成人世界做好准备。

The opposite is true. Freedom is a better way to shape a better future character. We teach kids to tolerate the reality, while they should rather let their reason figure out what is tolerable and what is welcome in proportion to brain development. Why tolerate toilet, sleep, meal, or sport timing restrictions in violation of the [circadian cycle](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_sleep)? Why tolerate departures from the [natural creativity cycle](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Natural_creativity_cycle)? It is smarter to be intolerant and learn to adapt in proportion to brain power and one's own intolerance! Let's adapt the world to humans, not the other way around. Children can be a great factor of change in that respect.

反之亦然。自由是塑造更美好未来品格的更好方式。我们教孩子们容忍现实，而他们应该让他们的理由弄清楚什么是可以忍受的，以及与大脑发育成比例的欢迎。为什么在违反昼夜周期的情况下容忍厕所，睡眠，用餐或运动时间限制？为什么容忍偏离自然创造周期？不宽容，学会适应脑力和自己不容忍的比例更聪明！让世界适应人类，而不是相反。在这方面，儿童可能是一个很大的变化因素。

**Youth should be devoted to brain development**. There is no stronger weapon than a well-developed brain. Learning and "preparation" come easy to a brisk brain. They can proceed in proportion to maturity. They can capitalize on the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) with minimal assistance from [optimum push](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Push_zone).

青年应该致力于大脑发育。没有比发达的大脑更强大的武器了。学习和「准备」很容易成为一个活泼的大脑。他们可以按比例成熟。他们可以利用最佳推动的最小帮助来充分利用学习动力。

### 18.5.2 Discipline training

## 纪律训练

Preparation for adulthood is not only about stress resilience. Many educators claim that kids who suffer no discipline won't be able to adapt to a job that requires a submission. This is false. All animals follow an instinctive drive for freedom. This drive has evolutionary benefits. Captured deer will struggle to the point of injury. Restrained puppy will yelp for freedom of space. Human mind that grows free from shackles will retain the quest for open spaces and freedom till the very end of life. For a healthy brain, there is very little difficulty in achieving self-restraint and self-discipline through reason. Limits on freedom in childhood may generate stress that may limit brain development that, later in life, paradoxically, will make it harder to impose self-discipline. On the other side of the equation, freedom fosters creativity, which is an equally priced possession. You do not need to be an employer to know that it is far easier for a creative individual to self-impose restraint than for a well-disciplined soldier to [become creative on demand](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Creativity:_abundant_but_suppressed!). Preparation for adulthood needs to take into account the immaturity of the brain. Taking on a hard 9-5 job may be easy for a high-IQ thirty-year-old. The same job may be highly stressful for a teen, bad for health for a 10-year-old, or a plain brain destroyer for a 5-year-old. We should celebrate the fact that we no longer need to send 8 year olds to handle a factory assembly line to earn a living.

成年期的准备不仅仅是关于压力恢复力。许多教育工作者声称，没有纪律的孩子将无法适应需要提交的工作。这是错误的。所有的动物都本能地追求自由。这种驱动器具有进化优势。捕获的鹿将挣扎到受伤点。受约束的小狗会为了自由而咆哮。从枷锁中生长出来的人类思维将保留对开放空间和自由的追求，直到生命的尽头。对于一个健康的大脑，通过理性实现自我约束和自我约束的难度很小。儿童时期自由的限制可能会产生压力，这种压力可能会限制大脑发育，而这种压力在以后的生活中会自相矛盾，会使自律更加难以实施。在另一方面，自由促进了创造力，这是一个同等价位的财产。你不需要成为一个雇主就知道，一个有创造力的个人自我施加克制要比一个训练有素的士兵更容易按需创造。成年期的准备需要考虑到大脑的不成熟。对于一个高智商的三十岁的孩子来说，接受艰苦的9-5工作可能很容易。对于一个10岁的孩子来说，同样的工作可能会给男孩带来很大的压力，对于一个5岁的孩子来说，对于一个普通的大脑驱逐舰也是如此。我们应该庆祝这样一个事实，即我们不再需要派8岁的孩子来处理工厂流水线以谋生。

## 18.6 Homeschooler's sleep

## 家庭教育学生的睡眠

Homeschoolers often boast that what they like most about learning at home is that they can get good sleep. **The right to get good sleep should be a basic human right for children**. Some professions involve inevitable sleep deprivation or interference with chronobiology. However, adaptations to "messy sleep" lifestyle are predominantly procedural, not biological. Going to sleep early, and sticking to regular sleep hours are both procedural adaptations. The only significant biological adaptation is the possibility of determining the sleep phase via [chronotherapy](http://super-memory.com/articles/sleep.htm#Curing_DSPS_and_insomnia). In the course of 2-3 weeks, an owl can be made into an early bird with the tools of chronobiology. This is again procedural adaptation that capitalizes on a single property of the sleep control system: [sleep phase](http://super-memory.com/articles/sleep.htm#Curing_DSPS_and_insomnia). This is not a biological adaptation that helps reduce the effects of sleep deprivation once it occurs.

家庭教育者经常夸耀他们最喜欢在家学习的是他们可以睡个好觉。获得良好睡眠的权利应该是儿童的基本人权。一些职业涉及不可避免的睡眠剥夺或干扰时间生物学。然而，对「凌乱睡眠」生活方式的适应主要是程序性的，而非生物性的。早睡，坚持正常的睡眠时间都是程序性的适应。唯一重要的生物适应是通过时间疗法确定睡眠阶段的可能性。在2-3周的过程中，可以使用时间生物学工具将猫头鹰制成早起的鸟类。这又是程序性适应，利用睡眠控制系统的单一属性：睡眠阶段。这不是一种生物适应，有助于减少睡眠剥夺的影响。

Torturing kids with an alarm clock to train school discipline is as bad as feeding them with alcohol. Both affect brain structures and permanently change lives. The only difference is that alarm clocks are still socially acceptable.

用闹钟来折磨孩子以训练学校纪律与用酒精喂养他们一样糟糕。两者都影响大脑结构并永久改变生活。唯一的区别是闹钟仍然是社会可接受的。

For contrast, imagine giving a child a 50ml glass of vodka in the morning. In terms of ravages to the brain and personality, this might be an alcohol equivalent of waking the kid up 2 hours before his or her optimum waking time (which might be the case for half the kids). Biologically speaking, the body can mount a degree of resistance to alcohol by streamlining the enzymatic engine needed to metabolise ethanol. In an extreme case, there might be no damage from alcohol. There are virtually no defenses against neural effects of sleep deprivation. Once you incur deprivation, you certainly incur damage.

相比之下，想象一下，早上给孩子一杯50毫升的伏特加酒。就大脑和人格的蹂躏而言，这可能是酒精相当于在他或她的最佳清醒时间前2小时唤醒孩子（这可能是一半孩子的情况）。从生物学角度讲，通过简化代谢乙醇所需的酶促引擎，身体可以对酒精产生一定程度的抵抗力。在极端情况下，酒精可能没有损坏。几乎没有防止睡眠剥夺的神经效应的防御。一旦你被剥夺，你肯定会受到伤害。

**We should never train kids to resist stress of sleep deprivation by exposure**. Trainability and adaptability are minimal. Damage is real, serious and long-lasting. Sleep deprivation in kids is one of the prime forces counteracting the [global increase in intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect).

我们永远不应该训练孩子抵抗暴露剥夺睡眠的压力。可训练性和适应性极低。伤害是真实的，严肃的和持久的。儿童的睡眠剥夺是抵消全球智力增长的主要力量之一。

## 18.7 Optimum stress exposure

## 最佳压力接触

Stress can be acute, i.e. sudden. It can also be chronic, i.e. long lasting. It is the [chronic stress than does most of the damage](http://www.humanstress.ca/stress/understand-your-stress/acute-vs-chronic-stress.html).

压力可能是急性的，即突然的。它也可以是慢性的，即持久的。这是慢性压力，而不是大多数伤害。

The formula for optimum stress exposure in development is pretty simple. **Kids should never be exposed to chronic stress**. [Eustress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustress) is welcome, esp. as a motivator. Acute stress can be employed only when there are demonstrable effects of known benefits. The underlying idea is that chronic stress is a brain destroyer. Via hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, chronic stress leads to restrictions on neurogenesis, brain growth and development. Even though [stress can improve learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_acceleration_via_stress), the benefits are short-term, and long-term outcomes are negative.

开发中最佳应力暴露的公式非常简单。孩子们永远不应该忍受慢性压力。特别欢迎Eustress。作为一个动力。只有在已知益处具有明显效果的情况下才能采用急性应激。根本的想法是慢性压力是大脑驱逐舰。通过下丘脑 - 垂体 - 肾上腺轴，慢性应激导致对神经发生，大脑生长和发育的限制。尽管压力可以改善学习，但短期效益是好的，而长期结果则是负面的。

The approach of stress shielding should be extended beyond puberty or perhaps even further. Not only is the brain still developing fast, at puberty, hormonal hurricanes blow through the young body. Stress in childhood and in adolescence is associated with changes in the brain structure and the development of mental disorders later in life.

应力屏蔽的方法应该延伸到青春期以后甚至可能更进一步。不仅大脑仍在快速发育，在青春期，荷尔蒙飓风吹过年轻的身体。儿童时期和青春期的压力与大脑结构的变化和以后生活中的精神障碍的发展有关。

Only fully formed brain is equipped with tools for declarative and procedural training that may help one [cope with stress](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/I_would_never_send_my_kids_to_school#Adaptation_to_stress). By procedural training, I mean rational choice of procedures that help cope with stress as opposed to natural neurohormonal responses to chronic stress that are always detrimental. An example of stress-combating procedure is the skill to compress stressful stimuli into selected windows in the [natural creativity cycle](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Natural_creativity_cycle), e.g. to precede or coincide with exercise, while protecting sensitive windows in the cycle, e.g. creativity windows, or the time before sleep when all stressors should be avoided, if possible, for the sake of uninterrupted well-timed healthy sleep. An adult can easily organize his day and employ such a circadian procedure to minimize the negative effects of stress. A child may find it difficult. Moreover, all exposure to stress affects brain development. In case of chronic stress, that effect is invariably negative.

只有完全形成的大脑才能配备声明和程序训练工具，可以帮助人们应对压力。通过程序训练，我的意思是理性选择有助于应对压力的程序，而不是对慢性压力的自然神经激素反应，而这些反应总是有害的。压力对抗程序的一个例子是在自然创造周期中将压力刺激压缩到选定窗口中的技能，例如，在锻炼之前或与锻炼一致，同时保护周期中的敏感窗口，例如创造性的窗户，或睡觉前的时间，如果可能的话，应该避免所有的压力因素，以便不间断的健康睡眠。成年人可以轻松地组织他的一天，并采用这样的昼夜节律程序，以尽量减少压力的负面影响。孩子可能会觉得困难。此外，所有暴露于压力都会影响大脑发育。在长期压力的情况下，这种影响总是消极的。

Major stressors may be unavoidable. Death of a parent is one of the worst stressors a child can face. This may be a matter of chance. However, most parents in modern world expose kids to chronic stress that can be avoided. Daycare is a prime example. Early weaning is another. Separating a child from her mom for the night, or waking kids early are also frequently exercised.

主要的压力源可能是不可避免的。父母的死亡是孩子可能面临的最严重的压力之一。这可能是偶然的。然而，现代世界的大多数父母都会让孩子面临可以避免的慢性压力。日托是一个很好的例子。早期断奶是另一种。将孩子与母亲分开过夜或早早醒来的孩子也经常被锻炼。

In addition to negative impact of stress hormones on the brain, there is a problem of epigenetic control of brain growth in response to environmental stressors. In short, the brain uses genetic machinery to get ready for the evil and dangerous world as reflected by child's environment or her perception thereof. A child raised in an unquestionably loving atmosphere is likely to develop all the neural weaponry needed to deal with stress on declarative and procedural platforms. On the other hand, child exposed to a major trauma or chronic stress will develop a brain with a different neurohormonal profile that is more likely to enhance neurotic aspects of his personality, increase chances of depression, reduce cortisol receptors in the hypothalamus and the hippocampus, remove CRH and ACTH release breaks, provide for the cortisol-oriented dominance of the HPA axis (hyperactive stress system), stunt neurogenesis, affect synaptic pruning, lower hippocampal volume, result in weaker hippocampal control, and so on.

除了应激激素对大脑的负面影响之外，还存在响应环境压力因素的大脑生长的表观遗传控制问题。简而言之，大脑使用遗传机制为儿童环境或其感知所反映的邪恶和危险世界做好准备。在毫无疑问的爱心氛围中长大的孩子可能会开发出处理声明和程序平台压力所需的所有神经武器。另一方面，暴露于严重创伤或慢性压力的儿童会发展出一种具有不同神经激素特征的大脑，这种大脑更有可能增强其个性的神经质方面，增加抑郁的机会，减少下丘脑和海马中的皮质醇受体，去除CRH和ACTH释放断裂，提供HPA轴的皮质醇定向优势（过度活跃的应激系统），特技神经发生，影响突触修剪，降低海马体积，导致较弱的海马控制，等等。

**The formula for genius is parental love. Exposure to trauma and chronic stress are harmful to brain growth.**

天才的公式是父母的爱。暴露于创伤和慢性压力对大脑生长有害。

The inevitable exposure to significant stress should be phased in gradually in adulthood when the brain is fully formed.

当大脑完全形成时，不可避免的暴露于显着的压力应该在成年期逐步分阶段进行。

Paradoxically, mixing up stress with love and shelter may be dangerous as well. The kid exposed to the stress of bullying may deepen the injury by ruminating his predicament in the confines of a loving home. This is why parents should also learn about the art of [stress inoculation](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/I_would_never_send_my_kids_to_school#Stress_resilience), which has nothing to do with chronic stress.

矛盾的是，将压力与爱情和庇护所混合起来也可能是危险的。暴露在欺凌压力下的孩子可能会在一个充满爱的家庭的范围内反复出现他的困境，从而加深了伤害。这就是为什么父母也应该了解压力接种的艺术，这与慢性压力无关。

## 18.8 Stress resilience

## 压力恢复力

If optimum stress exposure implies avoiding [chronic stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_stress) in childhood, how come some behavioral research in animals indicate that stress may improve resilience? For example, intermittent maternal separation may lead to more independent and emotionally sturdy animals? See: [Stress inoculation may improve resilience later in life](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_inoculation_may_improve_resilience_later_in_life)

如果最佳的压力暴露意味着避免儿童期的慢性压力，为什么动物的一些行为研究表明压力可以提高恢复力？例如，间歇性的母亲分离可能导致更独立和情绪更坚固的动物？请参阅：压力接种可以改善生命后期的恢复能力

The emphasis must then again go on the "chronic" aspect of chronic stress. Some forms of stress are good. They help learning. Locke and Rousseau spoke of hardening. [Psychology literature uses terms such as inoculating or toughening](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Chronic,_acute_and_intermittent_stress_exposure). In many circumstances stress is good for learning, development, and mental health. It can indeed lead to improved stress resilience.

然后，重点必须再次放在慢性压力的「慢性」方面。某些形式的压力是好的。他们帮助学习。洛克和卢梭谈到了强化。心理学文献使用诸如接种或增韧之类的术语。在许多情况下，压力有利于学习，发展和心理健康。它确实可以改善压力恢复能力。

Maternal separation has negative connotations, but we do not aim at making kids dependent on their mom until teen years. Separation is actually a goal of upbringing. In other words, it needs to proceed. It only needs to proceed incrementally and with respect to biological rhythms. The younger the kid, the greater the effect of separation. It should be avoided at times of sleep, or at nursing (before weaning). It should be avoided at times of crisis, incl. daily circadian drop in stress resilience, e.g. before sleep. Other than that, separation and exposure to acute stress can do wonders to healthy development, incl. emotional development. The best formula for incremental separation: let the kid decide!

产妇分离具有负面含义，但我们的目标不是让孩子在青少年时期依赖母亲。分离实际上是成长的目标。换句话说，它需要继续。它只需要逐步进行并且与生物节律有关。孩子越小，分离的效果越大。睡觉时或哺乳期（断奶前）应该避免。在危机时应该避免，包括。压力恢复的每日昼夜节律下降，例如睡觉前。除此之外，分离和暴露于急性压力可以创造健康发展的奇迹，包括。情绪发展。增量分离的最佳配方：让孩子决定！

Is it then a good idea to throw a kid out of a boat in the middle of a lake to teach him how to swim?

那么把一个孩子从湖中间的船上扔出来教他如何游泳是一个好主意吗？

I keep emphasizing the role of love in family and the need to protect kids from chronic stress. Should this not then be an outrageous and cruel idea?

我一直强调爱在家庭中的作用以及保护孩子免受慢性压力的需要。难道这不是一个令人愤慨和残忍的想法吗？

It actually depends on circumstances. In principle, this is not how effective swimming lessons should be delivered. However, there are many variables that will determine the outcome:

这实际上取决于具体情况。原则上，这不是游泳课程的有效性。但是，有许多变量将决定结果：

- **Child's interpretation**: the best primary indicator is the child's reaction to the event. Is it horror, or perhaps elation? This component is strongly related to personality, disposition, and context
- 儿童的解释：最好的主要指标是儿童对事件的反应。是恐怖，还是兴高采烈？这个组成部分与个性，性格和背景密切相关
- **Child's age**: right after birth, kids are pretty well adapted to diving and even surviving on the surface of water on their back. Throwing an untrained adult out of a boat is far less likely to bring anything good. Trying to teach a 50-year-old to swim is close to mission impossible. There are critical period windows in brain growth where stressful stimuli produce different programming effects on brain development, esp. in early childhood
- 孩子的年龄：出生后，孩子们非常适应潜水，甚至可以在背部的水面上生存。将未经训练的成年人从船上扔出去的可能性要小得多。试图教一个50岁的游泳是不可能完成的任务。在大脑发育中存在关键时期窗口，其中压力刺激对大脑发育产生不同的编程效应，尤其是。在童年早期
- **Circadian frame**: a child woken up prematurely in the early morning and thrown into cold water may experience true horror. The same kid at its circadian prime may cope pretty well, and in extreme cases, enjoy the experience
- 昼夜框架：一个孩子在清晨过早地醒来并被扔进冷水中可能会遇到真正的恐怖。昼夜节育的同一个孩子可以很好地应对，在极端情况下，享受体验
- **Sense of safety**: it is important who does the throwing. It is a securely attached caregiver (e.g. a loving parent)? Or is it an oppressor (e.g. hated step parent)?
- 安全感：投掷的重要性。这是一个安全依恋的看护人（例如爱心的父母）？或者它是压迫者（例如讨厌的父母）？

You may wonder why I picked this scary example with a boat. For ethical reasons, scientists would find it hard to execute similar experiments with monkeys, let alone children. We may never get a good scientific verdict on the procedure. However, it so happens that I know two brothers who have been trained using the said method (aged 19 and 13 in 2016). Both brothers are a picture of physical and mental health. Both do ok at school. Both are good swimmers. However, the older brother carries scars of his early training. When I asked him to swim across the pool under water, he hesitated. He admitted that longer periods without breathing under water bring back the horrifying memories from childhood. The younger brother does not have such issues. He actually does not even remember the shock training. Perhaps the variables listed in my analysis above played differently for him. The entire story is based on older brother's recollections. I was not able to take another angle from their radical father. Later in life, he turned to alcohol, abandoned his family, and moved to Germany. I would not be surprised if alcohol played a role in his choice of swimming lesson methodology.

你可能想知道为什么我用船选择这个可怕的例子。出于道德原因，科学家们发现很难用猴子进行类似的实验，更不用说儿童了。我们可能永远不会对程序做出好的科学判断。然而，碰巧我知道有两个兄弟使用上述方法接受过培训（2016年为19岁和13岁）。两兄弟都是身心健康的图景。两个都在学校做得好。两个都是很好的游泳选手。然而，哥哥带着他早期训练的伤疤。当我让他在水下游泳时，他犹豫了。他承认，没有在水下呼吸的较长时间带回了童年时代的可怕记忆。弟弟没有这样的问题。他实际上甚至不记得冲击训练。也许我上面分析中列出的变量对他来说有所不同。整个故事都基于哥哥的回忆。我无法从激进的父亲那里拿另一个角度。在以后的生活中，他转向酒精，抛弃了他的家人，搬到了德国。如果酒精在他选择的游泳课程方法中发挥作用，我不会感到惊讶。

Why am I not outraged at this parental attitude? The reason is that my first swimming lessons were in a very similar category. My brother, 16 years senior, was a great early coach and teacher. He would toss me off a 3-5 meter guard tower to deep water in a lake. I was 6 years old and I could not swim. However, the distance I needed to make was just 2-4 meters to the pier. The best part of the experience was the crowd of spectators who cheered a tiny guy taking a plunge from a height. I was a little showoff and for show I was ready to risk my life. If we review the list of factors affecting the outcome of the experience, I seem to have met all conditions for making it fun, positive and effective. I loved the crowd and cheers. I was not too old to be anxious. It was a middle of a hot day, and I trusted my brother as no one else in the world. It was great. After this radical start, I gradually improved my swimming skills to cross many scary lakes and rivers before my teens. Interestingly, later in life, I became more risk averse and lost some of my resilience, mostly through neglect. Last but not least, I was powerfully impacted by the movie "*The Jaws*". By the time I was 17 years old, swimming across a lake or out into sea would always bring back some scenes from the movie.

为什么我对这种父母态度不感到愤怒？原因是我的第一次游泳课程属于非常相似的类别。我的兄弟，16岁，是一位伟大的早期教练和老师。他会把我从一个3-5米长的警卫塔扔到湖里的深水里。我6岁，我不会游泳。然而，我需要的距离只有2-4米到码头。这次经历的最佳部分是一群观众，他们为一个从高处蹦蹦跳跳的小家伙欢呼。我有点炫耀，为了表演我已经准备好冒险了。如果我们查看影响体验结果的因素列表，我似乎已经满足了使其变得有趣，积极和有效的所有条件。我喜欢人群和欢呼。我不是太老了，不会焦虑。这是一个炎热的一天，我相信我的兄弟是世界上没有其他人。太棒了。在这个激进的开始之后，我逐渐提高了我的游泳技巧，在我十几岁之前穿越了许多可怕的湖泊和河流。有趣的是，在以后的生活中，我变得更加厌恶风险并且失去了一些我的弹性，主要是通过疏忽。最后但并非最不重要的是，我受到电影「大白鲨」的强烈影响。当我17岁的时候，游泳穿过湖泊或者进入大海总会带回电影中的一些场景。

[Peter Gray](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Peter_Gray) advocates trustful parenting. In the present world, it seems awfully hard, but without a degree of risk and hardening, we won't raise a generation of conquerors, astronauts, CEOs or perhaps even Einsteins.

彼得格雷提倡信任的养育。在当今世界，它似乎非常艰难，但如果没有一定程度的风险和硬化，我们就不会培养一代征服者，宇航员，首席执行官甚至爱因斯坦。

[John Taylor Gatto](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/John_Taylor_Gatto:_I_refuse_to_hurt_children) is even more radical. He claims that [Richard Branson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Branson)'s mother inspired him with the best formula for raising genius. When Branson was four, his mom, with his nod, dropped him off miles from home to find his way back on his own. Branson needed 8 hours. He succeeded and later claimed it was one of the best lessons he got in life. Nothing seemed like an impossible challenge any more.

约翰泰勒Gatto更加激进。他声称，理查德布兰森的母亲用他最好的抚养天才的方法激励他。当布兰森四岁的时候，他的妈妈点了点头，把他从家里甩了出去，找回了自己的路。布兰森需要8个小时。他成功了，后来声称这是他生命中最好的课程之一。似乎不再是一场不可能的挑战。

When I was 12, in summer 1974, my mom agreed I took a bike trip on old Polish communist roads to a city 150 km away (and later back). Today, I recall with horror huge fully-loaded trucks wheezing by. However, this kind of trip indeed leaves some strong imprint on a young mind. I took my best friend Piotr Ruta with me. On arrival to our destination, we slept in a haystack. On the way back, in the night, without lights, we were forced to sleep in a field of wheat in rain because we took a truck on the side of the road for a police car. We got soaked and chilled to the bone. The best part of the trip was the appreciation for the warmth of home and even for a decent meal. However, this trip did not do much to our genius. I was expelled from school a few months later for bad behavior. Ruta did not even bother to go to high school. He got a job in a nearby bakery where he stayed until a day when a tram car accident resulted in amputation of his foot in his early 20s. Perhaps, to benefit better, we should have taken the trip at the age of four?

当我12岁时，在1974年夏天，我的妈妈同意我在波兰老共产主义道路上骑自行车去150公里以外的城市（后来又回来了）。今天，我惊恐地回想起巨大的满载卡车。然而，这种旅行确实给年轻人留下了一些强烈的印记。我带着我最好的朋友Piotr Ruta。抵达目的地后，我们睡在干草堆里。在回来的路上，在夜晚没有灯光的情况下，我们被迫在雨中的麦田里睡觉，因为我们在路边的一辆卡车上开了一辆警车。我们被浸泡并冷却到骨头。这次旅行的最佳部分是对家的温暖，甚至是一顿正餐的欣赏。然而，这次旅行对我们的天才没有太大作用。因为不良行为，几个月后我被学校开除了。鲁塔甚至懒得去上高中。他在附近的一家面包店找到了一份工作，直到有一天，一辆电车车祸在20多岁时导致他的脚被截肢。也许，为了更好地受益，我们应该在四岁时旅行？

When tiny babies are thrown into an icehole in Ukraine, the reaction of a western mom is nearly universal: horror. As babies are pretty poor at "*planning ahead*", anticipatory chronic stress is not a factor. Therefore, the ultimate litmus test is the baby's response. If temporary shock is promptly replaced with a wide smile or euphoria, this type of acute stress exposure is likely to do a lot of good, in terms of overall health, brain health, and resilience.

当小小的婴儿被扔进乌克兰的一个冰洞时，西方妈妈的反应几乎是普遍的：恐怖。由于婴儿在「提前计划」方面相当差，预期的慢性压力不是一个因素。因此，最终的试金石是宝宝的反应。如果暂时的休克会立即被微笑或兴奋所取代，那么这种类型的急性应激暴露在整体健康，大脑健康和恢复力方面可能会有很大的好处。

In summary, **we should surround kids with love, shelter them from chronic stress, and keep the mind open when it comes to acute stress and beneficial stress inoculation**. On the other hand, **childhood without exposure to risk and acute stress is less likely to lead to resilience later in life**.

总之，我们应该用爱来包围孩子，避免慢性压力，并在急性压力和有益的压力接种时保持心态开放。另一方面，没有暴露于风险和急性压力的儿童不太可能在以后的生活中导致恢复力。
